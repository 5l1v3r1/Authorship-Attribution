page not found .  I hate it when bloggers quit. I don't know, it just seems like every time someone walks away, they leave this void...a void where there used to be content. My friend Charlie, the Blogstalker, is one of the best friends I never had via blogging. He's in New Orleans now... he doesn't update much, if at all, I feel like I've lost him, you know? And, hey, I know people blog for different reasons, so sometimes people just reach the end. I get it. I do. But even so, I'm sad to see my friend Verdezza hit the reset button on his. It's the nature of the beast, and new writers will provide new content, fresh perspectives and maybe new friendships.   I guess it never gets any easier to say goodbye.
