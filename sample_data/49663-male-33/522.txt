my big gay life (44)    random babbling and other detritus...   So, I have to say that the Stevie Nicks concert was fantastic! The old girl still got it! She's sounding great (due to lack of illicit substances and smoking) and her tech was gorgeous, too. She opened with  Stop Draggin' My Heart Around  (no, Tom Petty didn't show up as special unannounced guest) and then moved into  Rhiannon  and  Stand Back . Then she went into a buncha new songs from her most recent release "Trouble In Shangri-La." She, of course, had to kill me with her final encore  Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You?   I am looking forward to seeing James Taylor next week with my across-the-street neighbor, Thomas. That will about do it for my tour of 70's Rock Legends. Tonight after work, I am going to go take a nice long bike ride in the park...it's been awhile since I've been able to just jump on the bike and go...so I am looking forward to it.
