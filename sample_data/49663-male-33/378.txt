Lately, things seem a bit hazy. I am not unhappy, but I am also not  happy  happy. You know what I am saying? The goal for this week will be to refocus and reprioritize life...thus decluttering the path to happiness...or some garbage like that. At any rate, life is blazing along. Thanks for the great response to my experiemental voiceBlog. I am going to try and do a unique voiceBlog post there daily that will dovetail with what I write here...with out being duplicitous.
