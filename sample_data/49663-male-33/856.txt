People Are Noticing...    Producing a show is an amazing education! There are challenges and triumphs galore on the road to opening night. And, it seems that we've built up some nice momentum. We've drummed up quite a bit of local press, and have even done pieces for TheaterMania.com and will be the lead story on Playbill.com this Friday! Talk about doing something interesting in Cleveland and other people around the country taking notice!    Tonight was our first tech run in the theater space, and I was immediately reminded why I have such faith and praise for this show. Quite simply, it's brilliantly sung, charming and humorous. Even rehearsal was worth paying for. I woulda sold tickets if I could have...   So, getcher tickets now (we only have 100 seats per show) before they're all gone! Wouldn't it be cool if we had to extend?!! Well, let's get thru opening week, first. At any rate...wish us all the best! The critics are coming, the critics are coming!!!
