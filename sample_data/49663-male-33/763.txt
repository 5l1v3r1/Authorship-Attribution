karma chameleon    I guess some things do come 'round again to bite you in the ass. I talked to a friend today who said, before he moved to San Diego, Dan ( urlLink unravel in 58 ) was fired from his job at an ISP for, ironically, being on the internet, or misusing it or whatever. So, he'd been unemployed for about a year, traded in his high end automobile and headed west toward true love...or something like that. Amazing. See, interesting things happen to interesting people.
