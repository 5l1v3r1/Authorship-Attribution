After much discussion with my friend Trish in Philly, and a few too many stories about a pig named "Hank", we determined that what I saw from my bathroom window was most likely a full-grown   urlLink Potbellied pig ...very domesticated & quite dog-like in behavior.  Cool!  I want to go outside and pet it if I see it again. They don't bite, do they?
