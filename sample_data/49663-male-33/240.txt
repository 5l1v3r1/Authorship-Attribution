I visited DVDave last evening...he is called that because of his extensive collection of DVDs. As a proud new owner of a DVD player, I love raiding his collection...after all, it's better than Blockbuster. This week's selections include the classic thriller  I Know What You Did  starring Joan Crawford, and  Austin Powers  (just for fun). Tonight, I am going out to Chagrin for rehearsal, and then I'm stopping out at my friend Phil's to visit our friend Chrissy who is visiting from Maine...I think she's bringing lobster with her.
