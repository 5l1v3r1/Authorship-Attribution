Decided I need to start using club drugs. Okay, I'm just  totally  kidding, but see what happens to an idle mind? I am in the middle of writing the television and radio spots for our 2001-02 season..it's just the sort of solitary thing I need right now. I can just focus on creating 30 and 60 seconds of sheer genius. (HA!)
