I can't wait to see Jen (Jennie) tonight. She's in for a visit from the UK, and tonight is my designated time to play catch-up. I will dart over to her house after rehearsal. It's been a long time since we've seen each other. I am going to give her our compiled correspondence from the past year, as a Christmas gift. I hope she likes it! I never imagined I'd give it to her in person!
