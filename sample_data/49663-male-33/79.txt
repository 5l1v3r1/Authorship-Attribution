So, I was talking to a friend of mine at JIVE Records the other day...you know, JIVE, the home of, like, ALL the major bubblegummy pop acts: NSYNC, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, Aaron Carter, Joe...etc. And he says that the Backstreet Boys first release offa the new album will be uptempo...THANK GOD! They need to pull off a "Bye Bye Bye" in order to stay up in the rankings. I was thinking that the next new Olympic sport officially recognized by the IOC is: boybands. What do you think? I think it could work!
