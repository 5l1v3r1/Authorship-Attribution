Well, I hope my writing professor is happy now. A whole year of writing a buncha crap everyday. Well, that's what she said..."write something everyday." I only think I missed a few...some due to technical difficulties and a couple because I was tired, sick and/or lazy. Do I get some sort of prize?   actually...    wanna know what my prize is? I won BIG! I've made some great new friends, and even reunited with a long lost college friend...and managed to drag all y'all readers thru the LaBrea Tarpits of my lovelife...not bad for a year's work, huh? all I know is this:    I'm glad you were along for the ride.
