Happy Mother's Day, Mommy!   even though I know you don't actually read this...happy day, anyhow!  So, in the midst of Hell Week at work, I decided I needed to get back to my athletic roots, which, if you know me from way back, you know that means running. I have always worshipped my big sister...so, when she started distance training, so did I. She made the Cross Country team, so did I...etc. Anyhow, running was always a great source of exercise, discipline and endorphins. I also have always relished the sense of accomplishment that accompanies running any distance. So, I've recently hit the trail with a novice training program...working toward running the distances of 6 to 13 miles (what I used to run regularly). Already I am sore, but you can't buy the serene bliss that accompanies the training. I forgot what great mental focus it brings...such clarity. Anyhow, that's what I'm up to...
