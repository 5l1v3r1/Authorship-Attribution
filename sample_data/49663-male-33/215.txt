Some more lyrics hit me over the head last night. I guess it's time to get writing more songs. I'm due. Songs are really great because it's this perfect little capsule where you get to say/emote everything you want to. Good morning, by the way...I'm enjoying a nice steamy Chai latte. The weather here is decidedly Christmassy, with over 6 inches of snow on the ground, and most of it powdery white - except for where the dogs have been.
