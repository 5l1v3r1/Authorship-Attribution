It's almost time to bolt outta here for the weekend. I'll try to post when I can...my parents don't have REAL internet access...just WebTV. So, if I can get it to work, I'll post something pithy and interesting. If not, please speak to   Trish  in the E M e R G e   S.O.L. Department . She can be reached by clicking here  urlLink  Hello, SOL Department, how can I help you?
