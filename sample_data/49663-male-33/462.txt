Visiting Michelle last night doesn't really qualify as "my big gay life" but I watched the final episode of Survivor with her and a few old friends. Now, I haven't even seen a whole episode, ever...so I was completely in the dark. Naturally, I had several witty remarks to make during the screening - much to the delight of the straight folk seated in my vicinity. That Colby is a looker!  Don't mess with Texas!  I was rating each of the competitor's relative gayness. Thus far, I'm convinced that Maralyn, Jeff Varner, Mitchell and (possibly) Colby, are all gay.
