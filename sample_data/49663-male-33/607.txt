my big gay life (54)   Phil, one of my very best friends, and I auditioned for  The Wizard of Oz  last night. How gay is  that ?!?!! Pretty damn gay. Phil and I did the show two years ago, playing the Lion and Tin Man, respectively. We were once again auditioning for the same roles, and hoping to be cast in the show with our friend Ricki Gerald (Dorothy)...who is uber-talented and breaktakingly gorgeous! So, both Phil and I are on standby mode as we wait for the final casting information. I will say that I make a damn good Tin Man...even though  urlLink Jeff  is even better!   In other big gay news,  urlLink Charlie  is now enjoyng the fine Southern life in  urlLink New Orleans . He and Dex are adjusting well and I'm really happy that he seems so happy and grounded. If you haven't checked out his latest entries, do! I'm getting ready for a business trip to Nashville tomorrow. Between the Performing Arts Center Consortium and visiting my music publisher, I should be busy non-stop! Anyone have any suggestions for fun places to visit in Nashville?  urlLink Let me know !
