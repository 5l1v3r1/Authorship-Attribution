Update: I picked Matt up outside his dorm as planned. We went to lunch at the Cleveland Museum of Art...they've got a great little cafe there. We each grabbed a chicken caesar salad and some beverages, sat down and had a thoroughly charming, silly, giggly lunch. Afterwards, I drove him back...he wanted to drive around with me for awhile, but I had to get back to work. I dropped him off...and in the process, earned a kiss or two. FYI: he's a good kisser. We ALL know how important that is!
