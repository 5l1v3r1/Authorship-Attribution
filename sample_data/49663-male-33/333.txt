the subject of dreams  /  this day floats as in dreams from word to word /  my thoughts of him and his of mine returned, like echoes /  for all I have written for all I have said I have not said enough could not say enough /  my words tremble and fail, my heart does not /  his touch lingers the warm, sweet touch of this man remains /  I remember his kiss velvet on my lips, my lips which are his for the asking /  his words, his touch, his kiss swirl in my head as I drift into dreams of him
