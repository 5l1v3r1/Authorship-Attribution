Christmas in August.  We're a little late this year, I guess that's an understatement. Each year, my friend Marge and I exchange Christmas gifts months after the actual holiday...a silly tradition born of overcrowded holiday schedules and family commitments. So, tonight we exchanged gifts at a lovely little restaurant called Zin, near Shaker Square. I received a lovely sweatshirt and fleece pullover, plus some Starbucks coffee, candles and gift certificate to Pier 1. Not bad, eh?
