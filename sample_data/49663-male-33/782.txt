So, my sister did it...she and Nick are now legit. We saw them married yesterday amongst a small group of family and close friends. It was the first time I was able to meet his family...and just in time, really. I awoke today to the news of Nick's father's passing in the middle of the night. Obviously, the family is in so much emotional turmoil...between the heights of celebration to the deepest depths of grief. I haven't spoken to either Jen or Nick today, but I feel just awful for them both. Please send them all the prayers and good thoughts you can during this difficult time.
