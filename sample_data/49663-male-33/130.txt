I woke up the past two mornings lying next to the gently breathing, warm warm man - sweetened by the naivete only the morning brings. His arms around me - keeping me from moving - from leaving him. The very sweetness of his soul slips forward with every drowsy breath rendered. Sometimes, when he's deep in sleep, his lips smack, and he utters garbled, unintelligible sentences. As if he were at once speaking to me in code, and muttering secrets meant not at all for my ears. When morning blooms and we both stumble ungraciously into consciousness - that is, when realism and reality retaliate - devastate - for all of the stolen romantic moments, we are thrust into a coldness - bright light silvery and gray. There is no warm man here - no comfort, no embrace. Only quick morning ablutions and a swift retreat to school and work. But. In those moments. When it is still. When it is still darkness and quiet. My heart glows - asleep in him, his embrace, but somehow sensing it all the same. Memorizing it.
