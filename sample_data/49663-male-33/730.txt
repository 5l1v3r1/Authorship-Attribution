dating flashback   Back in the day, when I was a flaming heterosexual, I dated this great girl named Mary for about a year and a half. Mary and I met one summer while we were both working at  Sea World . Things were going great until she ran up to me crying and all upset one day. She said, "Why?! Just tell me what's wrong?!?!" And I was all like, "What are you talking about??" And she said, "You know!" And I said, "No I don't. What the hell are you crying about?!" She went on to tell me that there was a note attached to her timecard, a note supposedly from one of my friends at work saying I didn't want to date Mary anymore and she should just move on and not talk to me about it...and that I didn't want to discuss it. Of course, I had no idea what was going on and it became clear that someone was meddling with our relationship. How f*cked up is that?! In any case, Mary and I stayed together for another year before she moved away and I realized I was gay...which was more shocking than any forged note on a timecard.
