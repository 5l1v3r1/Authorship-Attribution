Anyhow. I'll suffice it to say that it's been a trying week. There's been all sorts or organizational upheaval around here, and things are starting to settle. My boss resigned and vacated the premises on Wednesday, and we've all been floating in limbo for a few days. It's not starting to feel normal yet, but maybe sometime next week. I got all kinds of off schedule with my routine this week, which has me feeling a wee bit out of sorts. My writing's been delayed, workouts rescheduled and life is just one big, fun question mark.
