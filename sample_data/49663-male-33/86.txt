Okay, I know I've been on this rant about meetings lately...but I seriously wanted to poke out my eyeballs today. The culprit was merely a 45 minute meeting to brief everyone on the progress of this new book we're publishing. As is typical, various participants start rambling WAY off course. I can't believe how inefficient some people are with words. They talk and talk and talk and barely say anything. Meanwhile, you realize you just wasted 45 minutes of your life that you will NEVER get back. I pouted all the way back to my desk.
