Today is one of those days that feels kinda like Sunday, because I had the day off yesterday...making IT feel like Saturday. I did a whole lot of NOTHING today...except go to the gym for a while with Kelly. It felt good to stretch out some of those muscles and put them thru their paces...nevermind that I am left completely lame in the process. I suppose the aches and pains will go away in a few days...
