For those of you who have asked, the opening of our treacherous little musicale opened quite triumphantly last evening. We are sold-out this entire week, and the audience's mean age is about 80, so we are a hit no matter what we do. I don't think the audiences (collectively) can see or hear all that well...which explains the mad rush for tickets. Today, I took Toby (my dog) to Starbucks for a triple grande latte and then for a walk at Edgewater Park. I've been prone to fits of crying these past two days. Not one to run away from emotion, I just let it happen and try to understand it later. Maybe it's some delayed break-up crud that's surfacing. In any case, I'm really doing just fine, but crying here and there. For the most part, I'm pretty happy. I've decided to experiment with a little voicemail blog. I am going to do a short blog entry on an extension mailbox on my home number. When you hear my greeting, hit 1 on the keypad and that will give you my voiceBlog. Just gonna try it out. If you want to check it out, my number is: 216-281-2237.
