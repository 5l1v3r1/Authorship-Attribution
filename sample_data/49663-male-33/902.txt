Do I seem concerned?   Well, I am! Something has clicked inside me...barely audible...but I cannot bear any more of this hyper-conservative rhetoric. I used to be able to roll my eyes and drop it...but I find it impossible to do so any longer. There is an increasing acceptance of discrimination against the GLBT community, and I find that completely alarming.  If you are a fair-minded person, what have YOU done to stop the disrimination to the GLBT community? If you have stood by as this "defense of marriage" legislation has passed in Ohio, your apathy makes you complicit. This stunning (or not-so-stunning) legislation is just one more reason why young, talented and creative minds are leaving Ohio and other locations where discrimination has been legislated.   I may not want to be "married," but I know I do want to be able to share benefits, hospital visitation and inheritance rights, among many other basic rights. This has never been about special rights...it is about EQUAL rights.  I am seriously pissed-off right now.  You should be, too.
