I'm back out in the country since yesterday. So far, there's been lots of early rising, excessive driving and one very road-weary Todd...and, as you may have noted, very little blogging going on. So sorry 'bout that. Not that it's all bad out here...it really is gorgeous. The nights get so dark, and the tree frogs and crickets are obnoxiously loud. Last night, Rusty kept growling and barking at something outside. After a few minutes of him making lots of noise, I decided to check it out. Canine prowler...some ragamuffin shep-lab mix running around the house and sticking his face in the windows...scared the S#%t outta me for a second. No wonder Rusty was going beserk! So, after this 3:45am sleep-depriving activity, I finally fell fast and far into a very deep sleep...only to be shattered awake at 6:45am by the alarm clock. See, at  my  house, I'd get up at 8:15, so anything earlier just about kills me. Just think, I get to do it three more times this week! Joy joy joy...
