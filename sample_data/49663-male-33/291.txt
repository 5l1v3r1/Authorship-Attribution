Lots of activity this weekend. Tonight, Miss Kelly goes on another date with  Cameron . I am excited for her, because he's bright, sweet, successful and a total hottie. Kelly's gonna get some sugar...for  sure ! I could meet Phil, Maryanne and Jim at the Winking Lizard, or I could just stay home and drink beer. Tomorrow, I might be traveling down to Mansfield for the memorial service of a family friend. She was 93. Tomorrow night, I am going to go see my friend's production of  Pippin . Sunday, I think I have off...a whole day to myself. Maybe I'll finally get all my lines learned. Do you have any fun plans for the weekend? Drop me a  urlLink line .
