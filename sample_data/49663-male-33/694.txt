I was reading one of Brandon's recent  urlLink posts  with a lot of interest. In it, he describes coming home and finding one of his drawing curiously relocated. So, he either has a stalker with a key to his apartment, or he's got a ghost...which reminded me of the good old days when I had three of them in my house. Yes, I miss the days of moved objects, strange sounds, ghostly footsteps and a dog that definitely saw and heard stuff I couldn't. But things were great after I bought Ghost-B-Gone! Yessiree...send me $20 and I'll send you the secret to living in a ghost-free environment!
