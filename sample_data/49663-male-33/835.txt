updates   If you're a regular visitor to this site, I apologize for the sporadic posting. Life in the analog world has kept me quite busy as of late. Work continues to be completely challenging in every facet. Non-work life of late has run the gamut. I've been able to  urlLink spend some quality time in my beloved outdoors...albeit swampy . I am eager to hit the trails on my new bike and give it a real breaking-in. I keep looking forward to the warm days ahead when I might be able to do some serious hiking. Somewhere in the back of my head, the Appalachian Trail is always beckoning. I keep thinking how awesome it would be if all of us working swells had 6-8 weeks of vacation we could take every year. Anyway.    This past weekend started with a tour performance of  The Sissy Show  at Slippery Rock University in Pennsylvania. After a grueling trip back and forth, I spent the remainder of the weekend with Trish, who was in visiting from Philly. We had lunch with our friend Phil, and a relaxing evening with Wyatt at the Market Avenue Wine Bar. But the real reason she came in for the visit was to see Bon Jovi at the arena last night. I have to admit, it was a terrific show!   So, right. I'm heading back to work now, but wanted to peek out and say hello. Have a good one...
