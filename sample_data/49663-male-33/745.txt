from the unextraordinary email box:  a note from Marc J.     Tod, in the end, all you can do is keep writing. Whatever you do, don't stop. I know it may not feel like it, but people are reading and thinking about the things you post. I suspect they're feeling more than they're thinking, cos I think you tend to make people feel and react, sometimes without knowing that's what's happening. Anyway, I just thought you should know.     -Marc J.   people actually read this thing?!
