Matinees will be the death of me.    See, after last night's show and party, I got home at 2:00 AM...hit the sack and woke up at 11 AM...only to have to be back at the theater at 1 PM. So, today's show was great and I have tonight off! Wheee! I wonder what trouble I can get into...hmmmm.  Hope your weekend is fun and relaxing. Check ya later...
