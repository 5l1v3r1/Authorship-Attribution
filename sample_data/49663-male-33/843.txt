updates.    The Lion King had its first performance last night. It looks like everything went off without a hitch. I ran into an old friend from high school while in the lobby last night. Since I went to a smallish school, I tend not to see people very often. I always find myself unexpectedly thrilled to see them. Not that I had a bad time of it in high school, but I never thought that many of the people there had much use for me. No one was ever mean or nasty. No one ever gay bashed me. But, I never had a strong sense of connection. Running into Mickey last night was so much fun...even just to say hello. It gave me hope that maybe we're all just a little older, wiser and nicer. I know...oh look at Todd wax nostalgic...he never does that. All I can say is that is was wonderful running into someone so intertwined with my past. Mickey and I went to school together from K thru 12. Maybe there will be the chance to keep in touch. Who knows.
