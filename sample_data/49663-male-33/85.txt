I am going back into the studio tonight to do some final mixing on a couple of tracks I've been working on for weeks. Doug (collaboration partner) says that it's REALLY sounding good, and he hopes to have the first 4 tunes shipped out and shopped in the next month. With all of his high-level connections, maybe I actually WILL sell a song. With my crappy luck, I'd sell my first tune to some low-brow outfit like "O-Town" (from ABC's "Making the Band") or Aaron Carter ( little bro to Backstreet Boys' Nick Carter ).
