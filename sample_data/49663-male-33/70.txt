I am terribly behind in my play-reading for the Play Study committee at the Chagrin Valley Little Theatre, or CVLT, as we call  it. These are the titles I am supposed to be reading RIGHT NOW: "Camping with Henry and Tom" by Mark St. Germain, "Over the River and Through the Woods" by Joe DiPietro, "The Last Night of Ballyhoo" by Alfred Uhry, "Side Man" by Warren Leight and "The Compleat Works of Wllm. Shkspr (abridged)" by The Reduced Shakespeare Company. So, I had better get busy and get some of this reading done. I must stop this Godless and infernal writing (the Devil's work) and get back to reading. Goodbye for now!
