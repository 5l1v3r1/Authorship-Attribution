Tricia is here visiting from Philly...and we've been having a great time! She's come to both performances of  Biloxi Blues  this weekend...and was there for our closing. It really was bittersweet saying goodbye to the show, the staff and the cast...best buncha guys I've worked with in a very long time! I know that I've managed to forge some friendships that I think will last a lifetime. On the other side,  Getting Away With Murder  still is driving me batty. I may have to bail-out this week.
