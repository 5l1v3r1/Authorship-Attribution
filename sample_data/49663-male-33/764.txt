brittle choices    Do you remember what you wanted to be when you were little? Or even what you wanted to be when you started college or vocational training, or whatever? I went to Ohio State as undeclared, even though I knew I wanted to do something, anything, with theatre and/or broadcasting and/or writing. As it turns out, working in entertainment marketing and public relations is a damned good match...but that was more or less accidental.   I've been thinking a lot lately about my friends who have found themselves, somehow, not quite where they expected. Friends who made it through law school, but not past the bar exam. Friends who have had major professional accomplishments, but have nowhere else to go. When we find ourselves at the end of the sidewalk, what's the next step? Do we hike backwards toward some other opportunity, or do we leap into the abyss?    Is it practical to dream? When you are over 30 years old, is that allowed? Or are we supposed to walk down some predisposed pathway toward the banal, the mundane, the ordinary?   I think when we were in our late teens and early twenties, possibilities seemed endless and we were less likely to limit ourselves. Where, exactly, do we lose that perspective along the way? I venture to guess that most of those opportunities are still available to us, even though we can't see them, or sense them like we did when we were younger and stupid (and I mean that in the nicest way possible).   What's to say me and my thirtysomething friends can't consider ourselves undeclared, like that first semester at college? Why can't we just hit the reset button and see what happens? Are we too defined by choices we made at twenty? Do we get another shot, or are we too far gone?
