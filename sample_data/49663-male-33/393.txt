Last night got a little weird. Good weird. Kelly and I had Laurie and Scott over for a cocktail before heading out to a benefit at the Beachland Ballroom. It was titled, "I Beg Your Parton," a tribute to Dolly Parton...and a benefit for  SWAY  this really cool 'zine Kelly's friend John Chaich publishes. We stayed there until midnight, and then headed back west to a neighborhood dive called Lou & Eddy's...complete with horrifyingly monstrous karaoke. Those Levi's commercials don't do this justice. We ate a lot of fried food, and by 2am, I was spent. I crashed immediately upon hitting my pillow. Today, I ran a few errands, went to the market to buy fruit for the fruit salad I'm making for Easter brunch. THen I decided I really needed to go for a good long hike in the woods, alone. A little soul-searchin' time, y'know? Anyway, it was wonderful! A really vigorous and healing 7 mile hike. I love those natural endorphines...  Strangely enough, I wrote a refrain for a new song...it's really gospelly and churchy. I know Doug will love it. Tonight, I am going to see  Bridget Jones's Diary  albeit with my parents...I know, it sounds glamourous and fabulous, doesn't it? I can't help it, I like hanging-out with the old timers.  Just kidding, Mom.
