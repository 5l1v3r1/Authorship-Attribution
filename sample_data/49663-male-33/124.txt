So, imagine my horror and disappointment when I sign onto AOL yesterday and find Matt online in the Chicago M4M room (gay smut chat room). Mortified. Hurt. Angry. Upset. After calming myself down, I finally talked with him. He apologized profusely...admitting he'd be livid if the tables were turned. Anyway...I want to trust him. I don't have the strength or energy to be suspicious. I think our relationship is a little clearer at this point...I won't tolerate any fuck-ups in the trust category. He said he was sorry and that he wouldn't do it again. So, with that said...only time will tell, eh?  I just think it's sad...I mean, it's not like he ended up in the room by accident, right?!
