little satisfaction to be had...   Not to be too maudlin, but it's been rough lately. It seems there is an interminable amount of drudgery and unhappiness to cope with here at work...and if that sounds really dramatic, well, I guess  it is . The point is to try and reverse the evil curses that have befallen you. There's no way to tell if you've been hexed, cursed or fallen victim to voodoo spells. I am fairly certain that I'm suffering from all three. October is the month to deal with these types of things and I am fairly certain that someone out there can offer me some sage advice. How does one un-curse one's self? How do you get to the root of an Amish hex? Do you do the voodoo undo done unto you? Weird forces are at play in my life right now...dark clouds have gathered and a chill wind blows...
