I used to be a Scout. My father was a Scout and a Scoutmaster. Scouting's been a big part of our family's history.

I ask you, who are the big sissies, now?!    urlLink Scouts Divided    Since a Supreme Court ruling against gays in the Boy Scouts, Americans are increasingly torn over a beloved institution.
