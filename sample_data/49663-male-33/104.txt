Another bright, sunny, clear day. Temperature: approximately 70 degrees. No humidity. I'd really rather be outside. One question: are you REALLY ACTUALLY excited for the Olympics? I just don't seem to find them exciting anymore. Maybe I'm wrong. Anyway, today, I am working on the National Tour of CABARET. I have to present the Marketing and PR strategy - so that might keep me busy for a while.
