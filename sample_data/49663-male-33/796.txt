Howdy!  Last night, I tried explaining the internet and weblogging to my 95 year-old grandmother.  Her head exploded.  The notion of the internet was so enormous, so vast, that it was nearly impossible to get her to wrap her mind around the concept. When we talked about blogging, she said, "Why on earth would anyone want to do that?!" and "But, what do the people who visit the site get out of it?" Hmm. I told her that absolutely all bloggers are egomaniacal and that all of our collective readers are dirty voyeurs. That seemed to click with her. She said, "Well, I wouldn't do it." I said, "Yes, you would." She said, "No." I said, "Yes." She smacked the side of my head and we were effectively finished with the discussion. But, I now have no greater wish than to bring you  GrannyBlog , the innermost thoughts of a 95 year old ex-flapper girl. I guess I'll have to keep working on that one.
