Jury Duty does not give me great comfort or faith in our judicial system. It's slow. It's clunky. It needs streamlining. It is not the best that it can be. I worry about the quality of the decisions being rendered when I look around at the folks sitting in the jury pool with me. If I ever had a jury trial, none of these folks would be considered my "peers." So, we almost made it to our 4pm dismissal time, but one last judge asked 16 of us to come in again tomorrow at 9 to go through the screening process. I am hoping to be screened out of service. Perhaps I'll be found to be too smart, too handsome, too accomplished at critical thinking...who knows. Wish me luck...I can't take that little green room any more. BLEH!
