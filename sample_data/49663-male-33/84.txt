There are crickets in the basement. Well, at least one REALLY NOISY cricket. At night, if you're anywhere near the kitchen or family room, all you can hear over the din of the television is the high-pitched chirp of a creature that SHOULD be living in the great outdoors. I went looking for it to no avail. The sound kept moving around the room...like it was throwing its voice...or tweeter...or whatever. So, I am resigned to live with this thing until it kicks the bucket.
