And I am also still smiling. A lot. I did get a chance to do some more writing while en route from Omaha...I probably need to work some more on that, see where it leads me. I was determined to use words as my photos of Omaha. Then again, I may just give up on it and write something else, completely. However, back to my desk...a crater full of papers and work needing to be done. Will I ever be ahead of the curve?? Hope you're having a great/productive day!! Talk to you later!  xoxo  Todd
