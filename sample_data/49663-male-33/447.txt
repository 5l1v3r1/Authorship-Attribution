Received another email from friend Patrick regarding this Saturday's benefit/party. It seems that I should really make an appearance, but it is closing night of  Le Grande Specticale Theatrique  and I will be expected to stay for the closing night party. Perhaps when that's wrapped-up by 12:30 or so, I should put in an appearance at Brooke's. What do you think?  urlLink email me
