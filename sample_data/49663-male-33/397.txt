Today's exciting news is that I got my brand-new dryer delivered! The guys came and hooked it up, and carted the old beast away. I now have a super-efficient gas dryer. Since it cost so much, I have only the funds to stay at home and do laundry all weekend. My mother insists that this  urlLink Maytag  is the best appliance made anywhere,  ever . I figure that I've done my share helping out the  durable goods  sector of our economy. What did  you  do??
