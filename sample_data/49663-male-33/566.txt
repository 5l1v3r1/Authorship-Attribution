I had an incredibly interesting update from Lee yesterday. He filled me in on the past 9 months of his life. I can't begin to explain the absolute roller-coaster he's been on both professionally and personally, but he's fine now. Some of the bullet points include being the target of blatant anti-gay discrimination, terrifying experiences with domestic violence and fucked-up interactions with the local authorities.  Messed up shit!  In any case, he's doing much better...the anti-gay issue has been resolved, the domestic violence perp. is no longer living in this country and hopefully, the legal issues will soon be completely resolved. My heart goes out to him. He's quite a survivor...things ain't never been easy for Lee, but he always manages to find success. I'm pleased he's back on his feet. As always, it's great just to catch up. Tonight, I am having dinner with my friend Margaret, and then Kelly and I will be going to Blues Jam over at the Parkview.
