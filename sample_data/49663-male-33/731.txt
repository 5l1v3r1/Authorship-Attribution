bounce right back   I visited my best friend in the hospital tonight. He's had a bit of surgery and made it out to the other side with flying colors. I didn't realize how stressy I was feeling until I received the phone call from his parents letting me know he'd come through okay. It seemed as though all of my anxieties were lifted in that moment, and only then did I realize how nervous I was.    In my short 31 years, I've had too many lessons about mortality, and too many friends leave this place prematurely. So, faced with the seriousness of any surgery, I guess I was fretting a bit more than I thought. But, it brought it all home to me once again: the fact that the little stuff  just doesn't matter . My friend is an extraordinary pigment in my life, and no matter what happens elsewhere in my life, that friendship is something way more important than spending time worrying about, well, stupid things. And while I understand that I am merely human, and thus prone to weird behavior like worrying and self-doubt, I am also a good person (insert Stuart Smalley joke here) who deserves only cool shit to happen to me. So, to life, I say:  bring it!  (especially if it's loads of cash and/or scantily-clad soccer players).
