Yesterday was really wonderful. After checking in at work for an hour or so, I went to the bike shop on Lorain to purchase a bike rack for my Jetta, a new Kryptonite lock and a slick new black bike helmet. Shortly thereafter, I went for a ride on the Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath. The weather was gorgeous and the ride, exhilirating. Afterwards, I helped move some furniture for my parents and then joined Kelly for a nice light supper.
