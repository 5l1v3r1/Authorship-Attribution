Hmmmm...I am beginning to wonder about the full moon. I'm not sleeping well, I'm lethargic, I'm in a crappy mood all day...nothing seems interesting or fun. I hate being in a funk!! So, I am determined to get thru it as swiftly as possible!  I think somebody needs to tell me a funny story...or at least one with a happy ending - what with those Russian sailors stuck at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a broken-down submarine. Is anyone doing anything to get them outta there? Seems a lot of Russian officials are doing  a lot of hemming and hawing on the whole thing....meanwhile I'm sure the U.S. and other countries could have been assisting at this point. By the time Russia agrees to let other nations help, there will be no oxygen left. See what I mean about my funky mood?! Damn!  Maybe I should just go read Dr. Seuss.
