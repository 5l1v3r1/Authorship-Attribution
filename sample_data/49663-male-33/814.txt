thoughts.   It's weird. The notion of home is so finite. But there are a few degrees of home, to be sure. The place at 8462 Rockspring Drive is where I spent my first 22 years, so that's home, right? So is the place where my parents live, even though I've only actually lived there for 5 months. Of course, there's the apartment I rented in Columbus, Ohio, on East Frambes, and the one I rented when I moved here to Cleveland in 1995...that one was on Clinton. So, they are all home, in a sense...at least, I feel that way toward those locations. But. There's this place I live now, this house I purchased five years ago...god, I can't believe it's been 5 years, and I was thinking (on my recent jaunt) how much I couldn't wait to get home...and what popped into my head is  this  place. This place from where I am currently rambling on from...not to end a sentence with a preposition...anyway. So, this is home. I sometimes walk through the rooms, looking at everything like it's not mine. Somehow, it's all still strange and wondrous and new. And, I'm here and it's snowing outside and I'm warm and safe and happy with most everything. It's good to be home.
