They keep trying to trick us into volunteering our time. Okay, let me back up...my work is having a big community open house on Sunday, September 10. We expect about 12, 000. This is our third year doing it. Everyone is expected to participate in some way...even though it's volunteer. So, whatever...the Committee (think: high school cheerleaders or Pep Squad idiots) keeps sending emails to the entire staff...reminding us daily of the event. Now, imagine....you're walking into work one day and you see post-it notes EVERYWHERE. Hundreds upon hundreds of post-it notes all over the offices and entire office building - each with quasi-cute remarks about the event. Somebody has a little too much time on their hands. ANyway, all of this "Pep Rally" mentality is taking it's toll. People are getting turned off very quickly. So, it must be true that everyone hates cheerleaders. No one wants to be caught dead following the cheerleader parade. Strange, but true.
