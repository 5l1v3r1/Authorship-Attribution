Rear View Mirror ...  Are we always on the precipice of change? I tend to think so. Change isn't always pretty or convenient, but it's definitely not a bad thing. I think, at times, it is the sole force moving me forward. If you can't move toward change, why move forward at all, right? The status quo is boring at best, and usually suffocating the rest of the time..so we plunge forward.  For me, there were equal parts sorrow and joy this year. I said hello to my niece, Marissa, and from May to August...a very long, devastating goodbye to my grandmother...a woman of incredible depth, intelligence and love.   I said goodbye to my dear friend Kelly, who moved to Providence, and even though she's only a phone call away, it's not like having her around the corner. She will always be a sister and mentor...and I will always long to have her closer.  And, in the darkest, most desolate hours of August, love took root...where now there was room.   It seems I have more clarity now, a gift for surviving and thriving in the past twelve months. More often than not, things did not turn out as I had wished, but the insights received far outweigh what I thought I wanted.  I continue to look inward to affect change on the outside.
