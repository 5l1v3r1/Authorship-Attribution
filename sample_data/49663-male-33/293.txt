Last night, on my way to rehearsal, I listened to an  old  tape I found in a box in my basement. It was one of the first cassette tapes I ever owned as a child, it was a recording of  The Muppet Movie  soundtrack. So, there I was, barrelling down the highway at 80mph, singing "Movin' Right Along" with Fozzie and Kermit and "Can You Picture That?" with that groovy rock band who's name I don't recall, but it had members named Floyd, and of course, Animal. This makes me want to go rent the DVD and watch it over. Most surprising was my reaction to Gonzo singing "I'm Going to Go Back There Someday," which made me burst into tears...I'm not sure why. Hmm...I wonder if they released that on CD...I should check & then add it to my wish list.
