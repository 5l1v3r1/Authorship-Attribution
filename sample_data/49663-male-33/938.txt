So, yeah. I went on one of my very infrequent trips to the local gay bar. Within 45 minutes, I'd managed to win a game I like to call  Ex-Boyfriend BINGO.  If you are the first to reach 5 ex boyfriends at any given location, your friends must buy your drinks for the rest of the evening...or you are allowed a guilt-free hasty retreat from said location. Anyway...I won, and I won  fast !    The absolute highlight of the evening was meeting the other gay Todd blogger in Cleveland...you can read him daily (as I do)  urlLink here . It was so cool to meet him face to face!!
