Cheap thrills and porch hootch. Watching the world go by on Bridge Avenue in the late summer afternoon. Just last week, we saw the fire department take a wrong turn on the way to a fire. They circled back and, evidently, found their target: a warehouse billowing black smoke a few blocks away. Kim and I are going to sit on the porch today: drinking beer and discussing cute guys. We're hoping some of those hottie firemen might stop by - hey, I have matches...I know how to use them. With my luck, I'd get the ugly Troll division. Any fun plans for the weekend? I have a friend's birthday dinner to attend to this evening. Tomorrow, we're having some sort of block party with all of the neighbors on the street. I think Dr. Tom might be there. Today is Jennie's birthday, so I want to say Happy Birthday and hello to my best friend in the UK.
