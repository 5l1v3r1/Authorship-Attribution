Salt Lake City:   Way too much to report right at the moment (I'm too far gone sleepy to do a good job). Suffice it to say, it's been amazing. I have so much to write about & will syndicate my SLC stuff over on Ohno Zone as well. Yes, I got to meet and hang out with everybody. Apolo's a great guy...
