sorry for the lapse. I had my friend Trish out for the holiday weekend and have been running around getting into all sorts of trouble. Okay, not really...but we've definitely had fun! So much so, that I seem to have come down with a particularly nasty summer cold. Yes, it's the same cold I get every summer around this time. Last night's list of symptoms and ailments included a 101 degree fever and dizzy spells. It doesn't get better than that, folks! Anyhow, today is TECH day for  FOOTLOOSE  and I'll be spending all of today in a darkened theatre. More later...
