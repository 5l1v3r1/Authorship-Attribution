I was driving away from rehearsal tonight and I was overcome by depression. I missed being with my friends from  Biloxi Blues  and I missed the fun of being together, rehearsing the show, going out, etc. So, there I was driving the same streets, to and from the same theatre, and I was really bummed. It just doesn't seem like  Getting Away With Murder  is going to be very good...and certainly nowhere near the incredible production of  Biloxi . So, it's hard to keep a stiff upper lip. The fact is, I don't really like many of the people involved in the new show and I fear they are talent-free (for the most part). And, trust me, I am aware that I sound like a giant diva, but I want the projects I work on to be good -  very  good. Otherwise, why waste my time? So, I started thinking...I need to find ways to make this a positive experience. I'll jot them down in the blog just as soon as I've thought of them. Should I just quit? Does that make me sound/look like a complete asshole? Should I just suck it up & deal?? Feel free to  urlLink register  your opinion.
