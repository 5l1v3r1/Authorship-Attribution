My friend  urlLink Andrew  had a very insightful  urlLink post  (for me), not necessarily because of what he shared, but because it brought up issues of disclosure + truth as a human being, and as a contributor to internet detritus via Blogger. How much should I disclose? Do I say too much? Should I even care what you think? I think my blog oscillates between chore and therapy. Lately, I haven't been dishing it out. For once, my personal life is needing to remain personal. It sheds a different light on how I used to post...a no-holds-barred post-o-matic freakshow, albeit entertaining, was perhaps a little too much. Then again, maybe not. My mother seemed to enjoy reading it. What do  urlLink you  think?
