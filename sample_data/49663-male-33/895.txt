My letter to Governor Taft   Dear Governor Taft,   As an intelligent and compassionate human being, I am flummoxed and exasperated at the passage of the "gay marriage" ban. I am disappointed in my fellow Ohioans who are obviously small-minded and bigoted. In a society where single people now outnumber married folk, the special protection of the "institution" of marriage seems inappropriately lopsided. Are we not compassionate enough to offer all citizens of this great state the same opportunities and benefits? How is it that we can legislate discrimination and hate?    I have been extremely vocal on this point and remain completely committed to an Ohio free from discrimination. Protecting the institution of marriage from a non-threat is ridiculous.   I know you have stated you will support this piece of bigoted legislation, and for that, I am extremely disappointed in you as Governor and as a human being.  Respectfully,   Todd R. Stuart
