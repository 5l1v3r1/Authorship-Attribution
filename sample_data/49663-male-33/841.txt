it's not like you asked for a list    There is something to be said for domesticity! Last evening, I stopped at the market for a few groceries. When I arrived at home, I helped my friend Margaret with some of the decision-making about the landscaping going on in my yard. Perhaps "landscaping' is too strong a term, but she is cleaning, planting and shaping my whole yard and so far, it's looking brilliant! While she was doing that, I busied myself in the kitchen preparing a quick, summery dinner of fresh salad, guacamole and turkey burgers. We watched bad cable television for the remainder of the evening and were treated to an amazing show of thunder and lightning. Somehow it was a nice balance to the bar-hopping shenanigans of late.
