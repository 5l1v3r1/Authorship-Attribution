I once went to Studio 54 in Las Vegas...I was invited to Tommy Tune's birthday party. He was in EFX at the time and I found myself in the faux recreation of the legendary nightclub, surrounded by the oddest bunch of celebrities. Paul Reubens (aka Pee Wee Herman) tried to cut in front of me as we waited to pass through the velvet rope. I know it  sounds  like a dream, but it really happened...
