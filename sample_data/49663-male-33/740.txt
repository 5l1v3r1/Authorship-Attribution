So,  Mamma Mia!  opened here this week and all hell broke loose...the show is virtually sold-out, and everyone is coming out of the woodwork looking for tickets.  Footloose  continues to be  very  entertaining on many levels (we had brush-up rehearsal last night), and I can think of no better way to spend a summer...   If you find yourself anywhere near Chagrin Falls between now and August 17, stop in and check it out! You won't be disappointed!! I'll try and post a pic or two when I get them.
