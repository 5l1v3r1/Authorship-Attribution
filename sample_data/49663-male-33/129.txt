Someday, remind me to tell you the story of Krabbe (pronounced "Crabby"), and how he came to be known as  Bath-House Bob . Shockingly, similar antics are in play right now in my life. Anyway, the beautiful prose-poetry which I have written about Matt makes me nauseous. I'll fill you in more when I can stomach it.
