Snotty Weekend     So, I barely survive Friday...my cold came into full bloom and I was extra miserable all day. Then went to rehearsal in the frozen barn, which helped make matters worse, no doubt. Saturday, downing all sorts of cold pills, vitamins, zinc and anything else that might remotely help. Then, migraine hit...a lingering one that lasted all the way past 8pm...and included a spectacular fit of migraine-related vomiting. Seriously considered poking ice pick thru temple. Pain subsided completely by 9:30pm.  Sunday morning, I woke with no migraine and, mysteriously, no cold symptoms. Is as if migraine killed the cold. Intriguing. Felt human again. Was brilliantly productive with domestic chores. Rewarded self with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.
