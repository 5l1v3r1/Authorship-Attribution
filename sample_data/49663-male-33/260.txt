Have I told you about being onstage in my underwear yet? In the production of  BILOXI BLUES , which opens this Friday at the  urlLink Chagrin Valley Little Theatre , me and the other guys get to spend a considerable amount of stage time in our boxer shorts. This would be okay during a more moderate, temperate weather season...but, since we run for four weeks in the dead of winter...we all are freezing our butts off. I can tell you there's nothing like parading around onstage in your skivvies...especially when you've got goosebumps all over. Pretty.  Very  pretty.
