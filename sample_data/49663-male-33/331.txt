Yesterday was terrific! I had the chance to have dinner with all of Phil's close friends while we celebrated his birthday! After a few too many sips of Chianti, we all headed home. I called Doug and asked if I could come over and work in the studio, which I did. I was able to cut a reasonably decent vocal on sorry, my latest tune,  sorry . Anyway, the studio party didn't end til somewhere slightly after 1AM. I collapsed into bed and drifted, very quickly, into slumber.
