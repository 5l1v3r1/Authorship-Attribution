All's well that ends well. I had a really nice afternoon and evening visiting friends and family. In the course of my travels, I realized I had a very important CD that Matt needs for his midterms tomorrow. So, I will be dropping it off at school during my lunch break. We'll see each other today and tomorrow, and then not for a whole week - between my trip to NY and his to Chicago. So far, it's a regular old Monday.
