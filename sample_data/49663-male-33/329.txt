Right. So, I get out to my car last night after the performance and there's something stuck on my windshield. I was thinking: "Crap! Somebody hit my car and left a note!" but it wasn't that at all. Remember how I said I must be dating the sweetest man on the planet? Well, he drove to Chagrin and left the nicest card for me...on my car...so I would find it after the show. He just wanted to let me know he was thinking about me.  Awww
