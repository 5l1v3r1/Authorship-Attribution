I have to string up Christmas lights tomorrow. Isn't it a little early? We received a memo at work requesting us to "volunteer" our time helping decorate Star Plaza (on the exterior of our offices) with X-Mas lights & the like. They're luring people down here on a Saturday with promises of food, drink and a good time...heh-heh...YEAH. My boss put the whole thing together, so guess who's ass is down there at 9am? Yep...me.
