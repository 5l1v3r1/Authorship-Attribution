Goodbye, Bomont...   Well,  Footloose  has finally come to an end. 300 costumes to get filed away under "miscellaneous '80's" and giant yellow and purple sets to be dismantled. As we closed the show, I couldn't help but think about the countless closing nights I've experienced on that stage, and many others...and the thing that always surprises me is...how  similar  they are. There's this odd mix of brooding and excitement, plus the mundane chores of striking sets, cleaning the dressing room and saying goodbye.    I had a good time this summer...it was time well spent. I dedicated my work on the show to the memory of Bob Stegmiller, who, at the time of his death, was still arguing with me about doing the show. He wanted me in it, I didn't. In the end, I succumbed...and had an amazing 8 weeks with the show as stage manager and as one of the handful of adults in the show.   I learned to love teenagers, for all their quirks and hormones, and I loved remembering being 17 or 18...and  just  like them. Maybe that was the whole point of the exercise. Maybe we see ourselves in looking back, a little. I recognized myself...an awkward teenager coming to terms with his sexuality...and I winced a little.    Today, I'll run a final show-related errand: I must return the roller skates we borrowed...and then it's totally over for me. I am not sure how many of them will actually stay in touch, but I hope that they do. After all, this crusty old stage manager is going to miss them. A lot.
