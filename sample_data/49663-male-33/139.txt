Well, it has been an interesting weekend. Not in the conventional sort of way...but interesting nonetheless. I retrieved Matthew from campus on Friday evening. We stopped at the grocery store and video store to pick up food and a movie. We ended up making a Boboli pizza and drinking nasty hard cider (so ghetto). We watched "Muriel's Wedding" which I had never seen all the way through. Saturday was set aside for visiting Cedar Point - which was a lot of fun! The weather was delightful and the few rides we actually rode - were great. We came home and rested before going to a party at Heather's...at which time Matt and I  got into a wee disagreement, and I was called "callous" for the second time in 6 days. Troubling. After a while we smoothed out the edges, but I am still concerned. More on this later. This morning, I took him back to school and I have the entire day to myself. I may go visit my sister and nephew - and maybe Grandma. I'll be sure to write more later!
