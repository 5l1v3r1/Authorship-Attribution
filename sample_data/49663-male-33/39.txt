We had a terrific evening riding the train. We had a staff outing last night which consisted of riding an old train through one of our National Forest areas. It really was quite fun, and included dinner, bar and lots of interoffice gossip. I had the chance to catch up with an old friend, who was a guest of Rachel's. Kimberly, Heather and I went for a drink (or two) at the Fulton AFTER the trip...at which point it was absolutely necessary to return home and fall fast asleep.
