Whoops! A whole week went by and not a single post. I guess that gives you some indication about how busy and crazy it's been.  The Lion King  settled into a nice, comfortable run at the State, while I continued the mental legwork of preparing contracts and agreements for   urlLink Those Seven Little Words  , which will open on July 25. If you're a reader of this blog, I'd like to extend you an invitation to come see the show. I think the cast is brilliant, and the material is hilarious and entertaining. Our first block of tickets is on sale now for performances July 25 through August 23.   Today, I'll spend the day with Kelly visiting our friend's Julie and Alex, who have set up an entire putt-putt course on their lawn. So, it should be a trip! Happy Independence Day, y'all!
