this update courtesy of my boredom: my vocal rehearsal last night went fairly well...I'm still trying to break-thru some of the nasty effects of my now long-departed cold. However, I was quite pleased that I could still sing, and that my cords aren't permanently paralyzed. Afterwards, I went to the studio with Doug to finish all the Post work on  Big City Lights . He did a fantastic lead take, and I think we gotta single. I'll keep you updated, as always.
