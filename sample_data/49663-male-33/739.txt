This past week reads like  urlLink  The Great Gatsby  , although sometimes I'm not sure if I feel more like Nick Carraway or Jay Gatsby. No, I haven't moved to West Egg, but I did have to jet off to NYC to tape a television special this week. We're doing a half-hour about our upcoming Broadway season, and had interviews with people from  urlLink The Producers ,  urlLink The Full Monty ,  urlLink 42nd Street  and  urlLink Disney's The Lion King . In between all of that, there were walks around the city, people-watching and meetings, there was shopping and dining at all the best places. There was ash-colored scenery and train rides from Penn Station, cocktail party invitations from mysterious strangers and secrets. Never before has a trip to the City been more intriguing, participating in the day-to-day life, rather than scurrying around to meetings and performances...seeing only the night time. Here, I was amidst the day people, rushing around to work, believeing myself in someplace new, entirely. It was at once familiar and enthralling. People scuttling up and down subway stairs, past 125-foot high advertisements, not blinking...not connecting. There were vendors and peddlers and beggars, there were accountants and actresses and worried television producers. And it was all there at once and completely inconsequential to me. As I shifted through the rush-hour herds at Penn Station, I felt quite like Nick Carraway, heading away from my Manhattan enchantress toward the more sensible, the more regular West Egg.
