taking care   My time here is winding down, and my friend is feeling and doing so much better. It is truly amazing how quickly the human body can recover from being sliced open and such. I am going to go spend a few hours this afternoon with my dad, so we can celebrate Father's Day together. I know I am biased, but I definitely have one of the best dad's around. And no, I am not kissing-up, he doesn't read this thing...   Talk to you all later. Much love, and thanks for stopping by!
