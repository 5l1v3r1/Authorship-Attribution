Saturday morning. Drinking some coffee, pondering WHEN I should take off for Toledo. For those of you who don't know, let me give you a brief geography lesson. Toledo is located in the Northwest corner of the state of Ohio.  Together with it's Northeastern corner city (Youngstown) they comprise of what is known as the  "armpits" of Ohio. So, it is without much joy and elation that I leave this place (Cleveland) and head to Toledo. However, if I manage, with the rest of my cast, to win...the trip to Ohio's Hell will have been worth it. But, here it is, Saturday, and all the possibilities here will just have to wait. I had a strange dream last night. I was picking up a friend from film school and we were flying over the campus. Then, we went to the cafeteria where we ate only grapes. That's all I can remember. Does anyone have one of those dream analysis books?
