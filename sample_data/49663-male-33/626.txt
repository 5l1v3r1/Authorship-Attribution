birthday girl   Today is Kelly's birthday soiree hosted by yours truly. I've been up cleaning and decluttering and reorganizing since 8am. I went to bed last night during a fierce rain/windstorm, and woke up to a nice leak in my family room ceiling. Ah, the freakin' joys of homeownership!! Not to fear, however, as many of you know...I'm great with drywall, spackle and paint. It just never seems to end. So, tonight...Ms. Kel's friends will stop over for wine, beer and munchies...very low-key and relaxing - just what the Doctor ordered.
