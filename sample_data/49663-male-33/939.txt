I'm moving. It's been ten years in Cleveland and it's time to shake things up! I have a wonderful  new job in a city that I love (not that I don't love Cleveland...'cos I do!) and I'm looking forward to the change. I'll still be in the same line of work, just working for a different company. Anyhow, I should be all squared away by mid August.    Anyone wanna buy a restored, historic Victorian in Ohio City with fabulous gay neighbors?               </Blog>
