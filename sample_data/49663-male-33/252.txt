okay. sue me. So I get a little sentimental...it's just that...well, I love and adore my friends (past and present) and sometimes things like this make me profoundly introspective and emotional. Call it existential illuminata...I've been found, therefore, I must  be ...or have  been  at one time (in order that I was lost in the first place). I get it, now...
