I think most of my creative energy right now is being expended on rehearsals, thus the extreme lack of writing. However, I expect to be back in the saddle soon...more  urlLink Damaged Boys ...more pithy commentary, etc. In an effort to keep more organized here, I am currently constructing a separate area for posts, links and photos of Apolo Anton Ohno for all you rabid fans, which should be up and running later this week.
