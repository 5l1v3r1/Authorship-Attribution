INTO THE ETHER... and other stories    this week:    Teflon Self-Esteem  or  The Bermuda Triangle Boyfriend   What are you supposed to feel when your date from last week goes M.I.A.? I never mentioned it last week because, well, I just didn't. I guess that after the whole Dan debacle was chronicled and published last year, I wanted to be a little more careful in how I approached the dating scene in regards to my blog. In any case, I met a really sweet guy last week...we'll call him "Rick." Rick just walked up to me, a complete (but totally hot looking) stranger, and handed me an ice-cold Corona (my drink of choice that night) and introduced himself. I have to admit, I am a chickenshit when it comes to the whole introduce-myself-to-a-stranger thing, so I was impressed with his chutzpah! As it turned out, he was a completely charming and handsome, if not a tad shy, person. Anyhow, we exchanged numbers and went our separate ways when the bar closed.    We made plans to hang out on Wednesday last week. It was a casual, low-key kind of date...just talking over a couple of drinks and hanging out. The whole evening was relaxed and fun...we had a great time together. We spoke on Thursday and talked about getting together on Friday. Friday came and went with no word from him, so did Saturday and Sunday. So, the fun little unexpected date once again goes rancid. Whatever happened, I hope he's not lying in a gutter somewhere sick or dead. Ah well...    Whatever...  As my friend Trish says, "Where'd he go? Doesn't he know that you'll have another boyfriend in like, ten minutes?!"   As soon as I learn anything, you can bet I'll lay it all out for you right here... watch this space.
