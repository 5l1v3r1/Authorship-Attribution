The faculty recital last night was terrif! Don and Vivian Weilerstein were unbelieveable! What talent! Again, i know almost nothing about classical music, but I really could appreciate the talent and artistry of their performances last night. We all went out afterwards to the Mad Greek Restaurant where we encountered a mad waiter (it was closing time). I had a delightful chat with both Vivian and Don.
