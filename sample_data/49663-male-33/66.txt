Rachel and I just stopped down to see the matinee performance of Julius LaRosa begin. He's an old crooner...so we wanted to check it out. Lo and behold, upon going back to the office, who do I bump into? None other than Dr. Tom visiting the building - he likes our coffee shop. Always nice to run into a handsome face.
