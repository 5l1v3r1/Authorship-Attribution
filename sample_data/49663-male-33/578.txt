My friend Belisha has the right idea:  move overseas ! No matter what you end up doing to support yourself, your life sounds easily 8x as glamourous as the rest of us...just because you don't live  here . In any case, she's freelancing as a proofreader for the publishing industry...hatched her own in-home business that frees her from the constraints of a normal 9-5 job...it also frees her from the constraints of a regular income, but why worry about  that ? Email  urlLink Belisha  and ask how she's doing. Tell her Todd sent ya...
