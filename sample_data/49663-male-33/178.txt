Tonight is supposedly the most busy night of the year for bars & nightclubs. I have chosen, for the first time in years, to stay in this evening. Given our recent storms, etc...I thought it would be nice just to stay home by myself. Joe is in Spain with Ali, so I find myself blissfully alone. Not that I don't miss him - I do. It's just nice to be by myself right now, doing whatever the hell I want to whenever I want to. If I don't see you, HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Blessings...
