The concert in Oberlin was incredible. An evening filled with amazing musical artistry. It was odd to be at a classical event with a different set of people. Until Joe, I had very infrequently participated in classical music events. So, there I was surrounded by this wonderful music, and I am reminded of him...and how he's back in Spain with his new lover, Miguel...and when the shame-spiral stopped...I realized I was okay, and there were plenty of hotties to scope at such an event. So, I did what any other man in my position would do, I got busy scoping...both the tenor and bass soloists were mighty fine, as were many members of the audience. By concert's end, I was alive with possibilities...having been reminded that life is full of opportunities. I have only just begun...
