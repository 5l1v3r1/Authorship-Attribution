my big gay life (38)    Okay, I am definitely feeling it today! Anything remotely connected to my elbows  hurt  from the workout yesterday. However,  after a few ibuprofen and some mash liquor, I seem to be feeling fine! Last night, Rachel and I hosted a rather impromptu porch party...complete with big citronella candles, Rolling Rock beer and munchies...pizza arrived later. The Bridge Av. porch party is always a guaranteed good time, and a great way to welcome the weekend! Today, I did a few chores 'round the house and went to go get the car washed. In a few, Dr. Tom (from across the street) and I are going to go biking down by the Ohio & Erie Canal towpath. I am going to go spend some time in studio with Doug tonight, kind of a nice catch-up before I head into tech week with  Chicago . I'll be back later with tales of lust, love and intrigue from the trail...
