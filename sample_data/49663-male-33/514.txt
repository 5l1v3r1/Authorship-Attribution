my big gay life (49)   Back from whirlwind weekend. I was house and kitty-sitting for my folks while they were on vacation. I even managed to get her medicated properly (you cat owners know how much they love pills and oral syringes). Two shows this weekend, a charity softball game and a nice relaxing evening in my own home last night. I had fun at the softball game because I got to see a couple friends I haven't seen in awhile. I also got to help my friend Margaret move (for the 2nd time in 3 months). I really like her new apartment, but I didn't like moving her piano up to the 2nd floor. I still feel like I haven't caught-up on all the sleep I didn't get this wekend...and I wish it was due to something more fun than house-sitting in the middle of nowhere. I get to do the house-sitting thing again next weekend at my friend Phil's house...but he's a smidge closer to civilization.
