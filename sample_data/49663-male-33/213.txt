What do Ricky Martin and George Michael have in common?                Oh giggle. Besides that.   We'll give you a wee hint. It has to do with Michael's beau, Kenny Goss, and his penchant for the sweet juice that can only come from exotic tropical island berries of the spicy Puerto Rican variety.   Rumors about our favorite Martin have taken flight once again, following news that Michael's oft stepped-out-upon better half might have shared more than just a passing regard for the loose-hipped singing sensation.     Like the vote in Florida, we may never know beyond all reasonable certainty, but like the vote in Florida -- well, we got eyes don't we?   Seems the Martin and Goss used to hang together on a semi-regular basis but, after a few turns round the garden, went their separate ways. "I saw Ricky a few times and we had a great time - but it all ended very suddenly," Kenny told WENN not long ago. "I started seeing George soon after."   Please note, ladies and gentlemen, the usage of "see" in Mr. Goss' remarks.   Ricky maintains the friendship was just and only that, and sporting yet another new and interesting hairstyle, denied yet again that he is a gay homosexual person. ( urlLink Datalounge )
