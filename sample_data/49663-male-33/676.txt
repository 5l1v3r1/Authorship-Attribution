So, last night it took me 35 minutes to go 3 miles. Why, you ask? We got NAILED with an unbelievable Lake Effect snowstorm...first of the whole winter season. Anyhow, I got home and shoveled snow...six inches had accumulated. However, it was all powdery and lovely. Now I want to go skiing!!!!!!!!!!     sigh...    I miss Andrew, Cinnamon and Brandon...
