Sorry for the delay in posting today. As per usual, things have been...well...accelerated, to say the least. I feel like I'm the Japanese bullet train running around today. How about you? One of my friends least likely to purchase tix to an *NSYNC concert announced she had done just that. They're back in Cleveland June 22, or something like that. I guess I should try to get seats. Anyone else going? I have to keep up on the latest and greatest popstar stuff...so it's mere research, you see.
