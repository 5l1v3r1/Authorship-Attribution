Recrudescent   So, I met up with my college friends Chris and Anne this past Saturday. Chris and I were freshman year roommates, one of those fortunate pairings that brought about a lot of fun and creativity. Anne was a friend from the Theater Department who got to know Chris through our frequent trips to the movies. Chris and I were dorm-bound freshmen and Anne had a car. Perfect!      photo: chris glass   Going back there was like traveling to another continent for me. It had been ten years since I had really visited. So, going back to Columbus this time was a major mental time-warp for me. I know it probably wasn't so much for them...but for me, there was something strange and familiar around every corner. I guess, in that sense, I was in my own little world...desperately trying to play catch-up with the city, my friends and myself. It was so wonderful to be able to sit and talk with both of them, remembering college and learning a little about the past ten years in their lives. While there have been a lot of big experiences and, no doubt, lots of stuff we didn't cover yet...things seemed comfortable...like we slipped back ten years. As Chris surmised, maybe we haven't really changed all that much.   I'm just really glad we did it. It made me happier than I thought...
