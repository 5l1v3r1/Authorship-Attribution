Just   who are   you people? I see that you come from countries all over the globe...that you tend to read  2-3 pages of EMeRGe, and then steer off into the ether. Some of you visit from the  urlLink Blogger  main page or directory, some from reciprocal links and of course, some from inane  urlLink Google  searches (I won't even go into it, but some of 'em are  ripe !)...but the rest of you...I can't figure it out...how do you do it? Drop me an  urlLink email .  Just curious
