Can you ravel?    It was almost a year ago that I was experiencing the end of a short-lived but very intense dating-sitch...lest I actually say 'relationship.' Time always provides perspective...and fodder for gossip queens. Anyhow,  urlLink unravel in 58  has inspired some amazing correspondences with many people across the globe...people I now count among my friends. It's funny...the way universal experiences can make friends out of strangers. So, it's fair to say...I feel totally raveled back up now. But, if you like watching train-wrecks...have a read...and maybe a laugh...and don't worry...I think Dan already read it.
