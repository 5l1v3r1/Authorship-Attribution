Saying goodbye to  Biloxi Blues  was really difficult. I hadn't imagined that would be the case when rehearsals began in early December, when a group of relative strangers all sat down to read through the script for the first time. Now, ten weeks later, I look back at the amazing journey that brought our entire company together. Every single one of us was entirely committed to making the show terrific...funny, poignant and seamless. A machine that required the utmost concentration and dedication of everyone involved...creative staff, front-of-house people, the tech. crew and the volunteer actors. I have never been so inspired, nor so richly rewarded by any other theatrical project. While I am sad it's over, I acknowledge the powerful effect both the process and the people had on my life.
