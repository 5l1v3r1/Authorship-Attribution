This Jesus-ing is hard work.   I suppose it's not enough that I show up on time, know my lyrics, blocking and the dumptruck-full of directing minutae which has been heaped upon me. No. Above that, I have publicity, interviews and photo calls...and most recently, a wig fitting. Let us not forget the nasty bruising and general abuse to my body which the entirety of Act II unleashes upon me...flogging, beating, crucifixion, etc...All this while incapacitated by this nasty bronchial-cold-sinusy thing which has made it very difficult to sing well. I am looking forward to resting a little tonight at home, organizing my life a little, watching a movie and drinking lots of hot tea. Tomorrow, I'm getting on one of those slick touring coach buses and taking a group of media-types to Pittsburgh to see  urlLink AIDA , which opens in Cleveland on March 12. Anyone want to go with? I have a few extra seats...
