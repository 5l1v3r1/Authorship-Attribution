Found via Blogger: one long lost friend! I haven't been in touch with Andrew for a long time. We met each other at Ohio State, and I think he's one of the best guys around! He managed to accidentally find me while making changes to his own blog. How freaky is  that ? Reunited by Blogger...who'da thunk it??
