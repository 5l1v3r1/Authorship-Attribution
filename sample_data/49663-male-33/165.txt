Matt and I are looking forward to our upcoming roadtrip to Philly this weekend. The map says the drive (straight-thru) should only take about 7.5 hours to complete. That means, if we leave here at 12 Noon...we could realistically be at Trish's house by 9pm no problem. This trek across Pennsylvania will come in handy as research - so I'll know exactly what it's like to drive to Trish's.
