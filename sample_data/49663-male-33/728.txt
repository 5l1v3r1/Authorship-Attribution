notes from the scene of recovery   I'm approaching my first twenty-four hours being on call at my friend's house. He's back from the hospital and progressing nicely. We're not sleeping much...he because he can't get comfortable, and me because I'm on alert & not sleeping deeply. On the bright side, he's in his own house and I'm glad to be able to help out during this very tough transition...although it's turned me into a bit of a mother hen. Toby is with me and we're making the best of a difficult situation. It is lovely to be out here in the country in all the lush greenery. I am getting caught up on some reading and have started to work on some writing. I must admit, it's hard to concentrate while keeping your senses on high alert! I'll keep you posted. In the meantime, keep both of us in your prayers...him for healing and me for patience.  Blessings...
