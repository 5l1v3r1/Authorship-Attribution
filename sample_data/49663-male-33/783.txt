Weddings are fun.  Really.  My sister did it right: she announced she was getting married about a week and a half ago...and the big day is tomorrow. After the initial shock that there was no time to plan anything, it slowly dawned on us in a positive light that  there was no time to plan anything.  Suddenly, there was nothing to get all bent out of shape about. The wedding would happen and fast! There is no time to bicker over anything...and by the time anyone gets worked-up over anything...the wedding will be a pleasant memory. So, I say,  way to go, Jen!  See, this keeps the focus on what's important about their union...and keeps the focus off of caterers, flowers and The Electric Slide.
