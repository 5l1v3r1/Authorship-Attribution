backwards toward new    They take form and devolve, like apparitions, figments I could barely remember. But, like the scent of it, some things we never forget. I remember when you were here, in this life, and we'd run toward the lake and sing as we crumpled under the weight of our own laughter, in the grass. We'd stain our knees and cuffs in verdant hues, the sky our floor...and the meadow, our ceiling. There was no end to it then, an endless train of nights and mornings, hitched together with purpose. We were foolish and reckless then, never anticipating change or death or vanishing or the simple end of it.     Like infinity, you skate an elegant figure eight in and out of me, and the tunnels and burrows have become slick and hardened, letting you pass through without sticking, quite without notice at all.  In one moment, you want my face to flicker recognition or absolution or hate, but I cannot do it. And I look blithely away, toward something...anything else.    No, you are not a part of my reconfiguration. I am constructing the new oasis from sky and grass and laughter. I am a construction of ages old love and memory and bitterroot. There are things I cultivate, and things I discard. There are no questions without answers, and so I move forward, toward everything I fear and everything unknown.     I wasn't that I didn't love you...
