Amazing ! I just received a voicemail message from Doug. Apparently, our demo CD  Swamp Yankee  landed in the right place. A music publishing firm in Nashville has optioned the rights to two of our songs  Missed The Train  and  Count On Me . I'm not quite sure what all of this means, exactly, but Doug will explain the intricacies soon enough. It's so wild to think that someone in the large corporate music industry machine actually optioned the rights to something I wrote. It's such a cool feeling!!! Yay me!
