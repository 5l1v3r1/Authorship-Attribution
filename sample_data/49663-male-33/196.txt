I am having dinner with my friend Adam tonight. It's been almost 3 months since I've seen him and it will be good to catch up! I think Matt is feeling a little jealous...no...I'm sure of it. But, we'll be renting a movie and hanging out later tonight anyway. Any suggestions on some good scary movies? We've been on a nasty little jag of seeing BAD BAD scary movies recently. Last night, we took in (or should I say WE were taken to the cleaners) when we saw  urlLink Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows . What?! Book of Shadows? There was no book in this movie!! There were no shadows! It's just a crazy DUMB flick. DON'T BOTHER. If you felt taken by the first one...this one will make you feel doubly idiotic if you spend cash money to see it.
