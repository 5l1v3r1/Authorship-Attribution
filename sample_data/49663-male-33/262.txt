I have just completed an archive recovery procedure...after experiencing a mild panic attack. I happened to click on my archives, only to see that the months of October and December were completely  missing .  AWOL . Gandhi. So, after some mild trifling and heavy petting, I have coaxed my computer to fork over the two months worth of random babblings and tales of the unextraordinary. Thankfully, everything was returned in it's original lackluster condition. Hoo-HA!
