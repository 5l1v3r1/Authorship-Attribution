my big gay life (3)                   I am worried. I need to be serious for a minute. This past week, I've had this mild discomfort/ache in my groin/testicles. It seems more pronounced when I sit, and it almost vanishes when I stand. I wanted to wait a couple days to see if I had just strained something. However, I fear I must now go to my doctor tomorrow to have it/them looked at. Naturally, all I can think about is testicular cancer or a hernia. These are nice, light issues for me to ponder as I go off to do the show tonight. In any case, I am going to the doctor as soon as they can see me. I'll let you know the outcome. Let's all hope it's something stupid and minor. The worst part is, it's not like I can say it might have been some wild sex injury...because, as we all know, I'm not having any of  that .
