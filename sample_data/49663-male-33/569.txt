Gorgeous! Today is a dream come true! It's, like, 78 degrees, sunny and  not  humid for once! I'm sorta schlumping around before I hafta hit the road again to go to the theatre...it all sounds so glamourous, doesn't it? Caffeine seems to have dissipated my earlier headache. To my chagrin, no hunky farm boys showed-up at Phil's Ranch out in Russell Twp. over the weekend. Not even handsome landscapers were to be seen. What good is going to the country when you're single if you can't even find some decent rural eye-candy? Tell me  that !
