Just checking in from out at the Stuart Homestead in lovely rural Portage County. Kelly and I went to the Clifton Diner this morning/afternoon for breakfast/lunch. We ran into a ton of people we knew...including the notorious Jason Romer. Also spotted: a major flirtatious cutie...no, I didn't get his name. Maybe next week...
