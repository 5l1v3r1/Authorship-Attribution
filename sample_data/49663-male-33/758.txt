jury summons   I'm not sure if I'm supposed to even mention it, but I am going to jury duty today at 1pm. This is interesting to me because, after all the elections I voted in, I've never been called to jury duty... ever . So, I get to see the inner workings of our justice system. I wish I could blog from there, but  I'm sure  that's a no-no.
