What a show! Barenaked Ladies were awesome!!! Matt and I had so much fun together at the show. He really seemed to enjoy his first pop/rock concert experience. We were able to laugh, meet new people in the loge and DRINK for FREE (which is always a major bonus in my book). This crazy married couple sent us a round of chocolate shots which are, in effect, a shot of Bailey's in an edible chocolate shotglass. After the concert, I brought Matt home to my house where we jumped into my big 2-person whirlpool bathtub. Soon afterward, we went to bed...drifting off to sleep next to each other. There is nothing so blissful as sleeping next to someone you really like. Yes, I suffered NBS (New Bed Syndrome) even though it was my bed. I always do. He had trouble sleeping as well...but we've vowed to practice, practice, practice until we get it right. This morning, I drove him back to the Institute for his 8:30 class. I drove home, showered and arrived at work at 8:55. Not bad, eh?
