So, I'm leaving the country right after this post, and all I have to show for it is my smashed finger. It looks like I'm gonna have one of those ugly purple-black spots under my nail. I wonder how long it will take to grow out? Going home to check on Toby and Kelly, then I have another show tonight at 7...so no fine Sunday evening cable programming for me...no  urlLink QAF  and no  urlLink SATC . What to do?
