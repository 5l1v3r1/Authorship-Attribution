my big gay life [22]   Well, I've returned. The city was just as I knew it would be: exhausting, wet and fun.It was  BIG , it was  GAY .  Fabulous ! I arrived on Monday morning, already pooped from my birthday weekend. I checked into the hotel and unpacked. I got a brief nap in before I had to meet the rest of the staff for the 1st ever  urlLink National Broadway Theatre Awards  (basically, the Tony Awards for touring shows). While there, I saw Robert Sean Leonard, Alan Cumming, Ben Vereen and Brian Stokes Mitchell...so that was fun. The following 3 days were jam-packed with meetings and various social gatherings. I did get to see a few shows, the latest revival of  urlLink Follies , the cotton-candy revival of  urlLink 42nd Street  and my favorite,  urlLink Proof  starring Mary-Louise Parker. She and it are going to win Tony Awards...mark my words.
