questions...   How is it that you can adore someone totally undeserving of your adoration?   How do you survive an entire summer with hormonal teenagers?   When does what you're doing become an obstacle in the greater scheme of your life?   When do you become your own biggest obstacle?   Can you overbook your life to disinclude any meaningful human relationships?   Have you already done the one really interesting thing in your life?   Do you prefer blueberry or banana nut muffins?
