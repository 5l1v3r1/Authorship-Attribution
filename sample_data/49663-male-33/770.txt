Well, I survived the family vacation in Virginia...even two rides through Sniper Alley on I-95 in Maryland and Virginia. I'm reporting live right now from NYC. I'm here to attend a conference and see a few shows. I saw Kathleen Turner and Jason Biggs in The Graduate tonight...it was quite a disappointment. Both of them seem to have merely a limited bag of acting tricks when it comes to this particular play. After twenty minutes, the show became a distraction from my inspection of the clever and smart technical design. That's never a good sign...   The city's alive with people enjoying the brisk fall weather. I will be meeting with one of the potential producers of the Sissy Show's NYC production. Oh, and I wanted to let you know that the newly recorded and mastered cast album is an amazing leap forward! Quite a fun listen! I'll let you know when it hits the market.
