I just don't get it. This whole month so far, I've been meeting people. When it rains, it pours. It started out with Jim, who I met on a Sunday a few weeks ago. There was this wonderful energy, VIBE, you know...the "click" that happens when you really dig someone and they dig you back. The vibe was totally kickin' between the two of us. Well, he travels a lot and so I didn't hold out a TON of hope...but enough to make myself frustrated. He was ALL shades of flirty with me...trust me...you want details? Email me. So, I give him my business card...it was discreet, but had all the pertinent info on it: the digits and the email. Have I heard from him? No. Do I still think that I will? Yes. My psychic friend says so.   Okay, so skip ahead a couple of days...that's when we pick up yesterday's ROCKY HORROR story. Ugh! No call from mystery David, and not a peep from cutie Dr. Tom across the street. What's a guy to do? I keep meeting all these great guys who clearly have SOME sort of interest and then NOTHING!!!  AAARRRRGGGGHHH! I guess there's nothing more to do but wait. Wait Wait Wait Wait Wait.  Any suggestions people?
