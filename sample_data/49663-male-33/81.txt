Does anyone else get sugar-shock or sugar-coma after eating dessert? I was taken to lunch today by one of my favorite sales reps, and she practically FORCED me to eat an entire wedge of delicious Key Lime pie. Okay, so I scarfed it up willingly, but the point is: that action is directly related to my inability to concentrate, stay awake and stay seated all at the same time. Sugar is surely a demon...sent from hell...where they make chocolate.
