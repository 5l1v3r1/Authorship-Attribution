Who likes Altoids? Raise your hands...okay. I received a   HUGE   tin of them as a gag Xmas gift a few weeks ago. It has proved to be one of the more popular items in my office. I have seen the "casual visit" traffic increase in my office by at least 30%. Which, of course, means that I am interrupted 30% more than usual. Thanks, Altoids!
