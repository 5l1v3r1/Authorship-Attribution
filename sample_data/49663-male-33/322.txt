Okay, well, that seemed to work. Now...I have this great debate going on, which is the better dryer: gas or electric? Just moments before my Florida trip, the dryer seized-up. Now, I am forced to purchase a new one and can't make up my mind. My old one was gas, but the new electric models are a bit cheaper. Does anyone have any thoughts on this one?
