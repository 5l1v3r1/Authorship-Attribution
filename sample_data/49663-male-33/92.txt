I'm not quite awake. Which is sad, really, because I've been at the office for over an hour. Mondays. I will be attending our weekly Marketing & Sales beating in just under 45 minutes. It is our weekly chance to be demoralized and abused by other staff members. I quite like it...it gets my ire up & I get all sassy.  Wheeee!!! MORE COFFEE!!!!
