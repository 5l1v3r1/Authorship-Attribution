Again, it's the weekend. I've got my final two performances...the end is finally in sight! Woo-HOO! My parents are coming to the show tonight...I finally gave them permission. In one sense, it's been fun because the whole run is sold-out. However, I am eager to have my own time back for a little while before I jump into a new show. I know I want to spend more time in the studio tomorrow afternoon & spend Sunday afternoon with my mom. Right now, I'm really feeling like I'd like to have a nap.  yawn .
