So, I went to the concert last night...which was really enjoyable. But, I have to say, the sheer number of people at Blossom last night really kinda detracted from some of the fun. However, Jimmy was in rare form, and we all had a terrific night. I left a few minutes early so I wouldn't get stuck in the horrible traffic log-jam that happens out there. Blossom is situated in the middle of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, and is serviced by 2 and 3 lane roads in and out of the park...so no matter what, you're stuck for awhile! Tonight, I resume rehearsals for  Murder by the Falls , an annual interactive fundraiser for the theatre. Other than that, no too much going on. I am looking forward to my extra-long weekend with Tricia in Philly!
