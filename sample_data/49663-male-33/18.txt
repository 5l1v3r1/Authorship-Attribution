Okay, well I managed to sleep well...FINALLY! I see they haven't made too much progress on that submarine thingy.  So, who watched the 2gether: The Series premiere? :::Looking out over Bloggerland to see all the teen girly hands raised:::  I only got to see part of the end of the episode. I adored the MAKING THE VIDEO for "The Hardest Part of Breaking Up (Is Getting Back Your Stuff)." No one spoofs the boyband phenomenon better than the people who created 2gether!!    Is anyone else having trouble concentrating???
