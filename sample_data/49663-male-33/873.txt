My life in fast-forward...    Until this week, it's all been a blur. Rehearsals. Shows. Grandma. Work. Now, I actually have some free time and I'm loving it. It feels almost foreign, but wonderful. It's nice to have no obligation to be anywhere after work. I can just catch up with my friends, nap, go out...it's all there. This weekend I have to help my friend Michelle prepare for her wedding which is next week. It'll be nice to catch up with her before the total chaos of the wedding hits.
