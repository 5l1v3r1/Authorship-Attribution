We did have lobster last night...fresh from Maine. Now, not really knowing how to correctly disassemble a lobster...I looked quite like a two-year-old at the dinner table. I managed with a little help from our friend Chris. Rehearsal was another story. Our director, Bob, never bothered to show up, leaving the 7 of us high and dry. I was encouraged by the fact that everyone still wanted to stay and rehearse...so we ran through Act One twice before disbanding for the evening. At least they show some  sticktoitiveness .
