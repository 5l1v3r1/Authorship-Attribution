live from Costa Mesa       I made it out to Cali in one piece, and no worse for the wear. My direct flight from Cleveland was actually about 15 minutes early. I was jonesing from the lack of coffee - I don't like drinking coffee before and during long flights - and so my first stop was for a small cup of joe to ward of my looming and predictable travel headache. I always seem to get headaches while traveling. I used to think it was because of dehydration or something, but it matters not if I drink lots of water...within ten minutes of landing, I'm sprouting what can sometimes be a very nasty migraine.    I have to admit that it was nice to step outside the terminal and see sunshine, green and palm trees. It has this automatic calming effect. I didn't see much, if any, of L.A. today, as I was immediately whisked off to Costa Mesa to prepare for the conference. I've walked around the "compound" here...it's gorgeous. The hotel is built adjacent to a lagoon/lake around which there are restaurants, condos, apartments, etc. There is a wonderful winding pathway that meanders in a large loop around the lagoon and other properties here. I am sitting here at the desk in my room with the patio sliding doors open and a lovely evening breeze wafting through the curtains.    Tomorrow, we begin the conference in earnest. It will be so good to see some of my favorite colleagues from around the country. So, there is positivity. I no longer feel that, er, doom I mentioned on Monday. Suffice it to say, there's a lot going on right now that I haven't mentioned here. I thought I'd do an experiment and see what it was like to not spill the beans about everything. Anyhow, things are looking up, kids! Special thanks to my friends for always listening and for always being there. Kelly, I can't thank you enough, baby!     Well, since I'm in beautiful California, I'm off to go find some guys...I mean, take in the scenery.    Ciao!
