Vegas, Baby!!   It was the perfect reprieve...a chance to pop out of the daily routine and fly off somewhere to be completely carefree and irresponsible for a few days...and I loved it! We flew out on Saturday and returned yesterday. Designed as part getaway and part birthday celebration for Jeff, I definitely returned very well rested and restored. I didn't win big this time...but I didn't lose much, either. Ah well! Better luck next time, eh?!
