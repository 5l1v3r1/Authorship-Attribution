garons endommags (damaged boys)        twenty-one       walking north     There was the inevitable tabloid news coverage of the entire ordeal...his bad choices aired in front of family and judgemental strangers. Kyle found himself not only in intense physical therapy, but the subject of intense scrutiny. He remembered it vividly, the name-calling, the hate and the violence. It was strange how the words hurt worse than the tissue damage, the broken bones and bruises the color of eggplant.     Hed relived the moment a thousand times over in his head. Hed regretted the whole night. He regretted Daniel, regretted his own low self-esteem, his bad choices and his fear of being alone. He regretted a lot of things he couldnt change. His mother had come right away, of course, and brought with her anxiety, judgement and sadnessas if he didnt have enough of those things. But, she was there at least, and it was better than no one at all. And, when it became apparent he would make a full recovery, she could encircle him with blame, scolding him like a baby. Maybe he needed to hear it.     Kyle missed Braden. No, he missed being with someone, anyone, who could make him feel loved and wanted. And, with that, Kyle turned a corner and started to understand himselfa little.    The weeks of recovery and rehabilitation were grueling, and hed promised himself hed get through it in time for the spring thaw, and a summer full of camping and hiking. He loved the escape from the city, the opportunity to be in the middle of nowhere, responsible only for himself. He kept a picture of the dense green forest in his minds eye to remind him what lay beyond the sterility and exhaustion and pain of recovery.     Kyle dreamed of the swallows alight on the evening sky, and the cool trickle of an unexpected spring deep in the pines. He imagined the rolling hills giving way to the mountains and the perfection of the trails in Virginia and North Carolina. He dreamed of hiking north on the Appalachian Trail and making friends from strangers, and being liked for being himself. When he was in seventh grade, he and his best friend Randy Bicking, planned to hike the entire AT when they turned eighteen. They even plotted where they would have mail drops, where they would overnight and how they might make enough money to pay for the five-month excursion. Hed not thought much about it after Randy moved away at the end of their freshman year in high school.     His pulse quickened. It seemed, to him, that this might be the answera journey all his ownaway from the madness, away from the hurt and the fear, away from the Kyle hed come to hate. It was a way of sorting out the detritus of his life, shifting perspectives and putting distance between himself and his not-so-distant past. At once, it seemed obvious and absolutely right. If he could get strong enough by early April, he could set off to Springer Mountain near Amicalola Falls, Georgia, and start walking North toward Katahdin.
