So, Matt is a student at the Institute of Music (one of the best schools in the country) and he's training to be a composer. He's really quite talented, and is teching me a lot about classical music. I really really like him - and everyday he becomes more and more endeared to me. It's hard to explain after it being so long ago that I even felt remotely similar feelings about someone. I truly don't know him well - there is so much to learn. What I do know about him, I love. How often was I like that cat in the Pepe LePew cartoons...scrambling to get away? I can't seem to get enough of Matt. This is simply an observation I find quite interesting. One of his most important attributes is that he's from Philly...which automatically makes him extremely high on my list. LOL You know how I love my peeps from Philadelphia.
