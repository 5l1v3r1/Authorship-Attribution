I apologize for being remiss in posting today. It's been extremely busy here at work, and I haven't had a moment to spare. The big news in Cleveland this day is that  Sea World  has been SOLD to Six Flags. It's kinda sad for me, I spent 6 of the best summers working there as a narrator for the animal exhibits. I can't imagine our lil metropolis without it. Apparently, Six Flags will still operate the park as a marine park, but it will now be combined with their adjacent amusement park property.  Weird weird weird.
