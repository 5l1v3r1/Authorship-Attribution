More random babbling (I'm in a writing mood today). Catching an eyeful: today started out REALLY well! You'll all remember Dr. Tom...right? As I was leaving the house this morning, around 8:30am EST, Dr. Tom comes bolting out of his house with a bag of garbage in nothing but boxer shorts! Well, I almost hit the passing school bus as I pulled out onto the street. However, the joke is really on him. Garbage day isn't until tomorrow.
