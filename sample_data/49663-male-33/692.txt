weekend update     Alright, so we opened  Wizard of Oz  this weekend to a screaming audience of toddlers, and our attendance rocketed to a near capacity crowd yesterday. After the matinee, I had a quick dinner with a few cast & crew, and then rushed off to  Superstar  rehearsal, but not before getting tagged for speeding on my way. Well, I figured that my number was finally up, I mean, I've never gotten a tickets for anything in 14 years of driving. Oh well...at least the guy who stopped me was courteous and professional. He even offered to fellate me, but I said no. Still, he ended up fucking me with a $70 fine. So, I get to rehearsal and sing through the show with the whole cast and suddenly I'm feeling much more, how do you say..."son of God-ish" and I nail "Gethsemane," Jesus' Act 2 rock-aria, just before we wrap at 9pm. Suitably impressed with myself, I wander out into the street to be greeted with the worst snow we've seen all season. Gingerly, I drive home and collapse into bed. How was your weekend?
