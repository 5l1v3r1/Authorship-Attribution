I don't offer tutelage in kissing anymore...the seminar has been defunct for a year or so. However, I consulted with several reputable 7th graders, who all said kissing the inside of your elbow is an effective training tool. I will add you to my mailing list so that when, and if, I offer the classes again, you'll be among the first notified...     thanks for thinking of me, though!    Todd
