Well, I'm coming up on my one year anniversary of Blogging (Aug. 10). The first time I heard about it was in some random email from the kind folks at  urlLink EarthSkank ...talkin' 'bout some online journaling. So, I checked it out...and being an avid analog journaler, I thought this might be fun to try...plus it helped with my writing teacher's instructions to write something... anything ...every day. So, here I am a whole year later with tons of random written detritus, feeling wildly validated and overexposed. I think I deserve a month in Capri.
