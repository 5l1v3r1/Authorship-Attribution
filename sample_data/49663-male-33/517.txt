my big gay life (48)   So, when is it called  dating ? In theory, say you had this friend, and this friend went to the James Taylor concert with another friend. And, after the show (which was really good, by the way...) this friend and the other friend were driving out of the parking lot, and one of them grabs the other's hand...net result: hand-holding. And let's say, for instance, that the hand-holding continued on the 40 minute drive home...well, not home, but to an all-nite diner for some pie...and then again home from said diner. And suppose that when home one friend said goodnight to the other, pecked on the cheek and went home. Supposing all of this happened, would you be inclined to call it a date?  urlLink vote
