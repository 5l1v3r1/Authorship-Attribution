As is always the case, it ain't over until it's over...I pondered long and hard whether I was even going to mention this in my blog, but I think honesty is the key issue that propels this one forward. Anyway, I get home yesterday and there's a postcard sitting on my kitchen counter. Upon closer inspection, I see that it's from Barcelona...that's it's from Joe. Of course I am thinking  What the HELL is he doing?!?!  but then I look at the postmark and the content of the postcard and realize it was written during his first trip, before he started scrogging the new guy, but mailed WAY after he returned to the USA. So, it would seem someone mailed it FOR him. Anyway, that's enough time spent on that...but the point is: they  always  come back in some way...emails, letters, phone calls or postcards...it's never truly over in their minds.  OK, so I'm done with that subject.
