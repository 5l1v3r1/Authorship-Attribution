I have triumphed over the last 24 hours. I have lived in the moment, not in denial. Yet, I have managed to maintain vulnerability and humility. As always, my friends and family shared kind words, a  thoughtfulness so touching, and inspiring. But here, in the long lonely hours of night, I come face to face with the sadness and rejection. My cheeks flush and I feel like I have somehow failed. I know this is not true, but it's the feeling, nevertheless. Sometimes I hate the night. Sitting in the darkness when sorrow visits, entertaining the seemingly endless pit in my stomach. Begging for sleep...for rest, or reprieve. The night and the gloom suffocating and choking...there and yet leaving me always...alone.
