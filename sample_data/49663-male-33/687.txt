at the end of the yellow brick road...     It's weird, we finished up today after a nearly sold-out matinee and hit the whole strike routine. For you non-theatre types, that's when the sets, lights, costumes and all other technical equipment gets packed up and loaded out of the theater. So, you finish your last, show, change out of costume and makeup, meet any friends...and instead of heading off to dinner or a party or whatever, you help deconstruct the very thing you've been working on for weeks or months. It's always a weird time.    Most of us were happy to finish our run, but it's always a little sad to say goodbye. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to do the show with one of my best friends, Phil, and to have had the chance to work again with Ricki.    I've been on one of the most celebrated journeys a performer can take...a journey in an iconic role, recognizable to 95% of the population...getting to know the ins and outs of a great new character (I was the Tinman once before) and getting to hit the bricks with so many wonderful friends. When I look back over my shoulder, I guess I'll always see Scarecrow, Lion, Tinman and Dorothy (and even Toto) waiting patiently in Oz, at the edge of the Emerald City...waiting to welcome me back. Oz has the most amazing ability to enchant the audience, and how could you not be in love with magic like that? Longing for the very things we cannot see in ourselves, and ultimately finding them, is the magic of this place, and I shall miss it greatly.    Goodbye Scarecrow...I think I'll miss you most of all.
