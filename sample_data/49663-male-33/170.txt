I'm going on a short vacation with Trish starting tomorrow. We'll be in Colonial Williamsburg thru Monday, the 4th. Sorry I'll have to be away from you for awhile...but I think it's just what I need right now...especially since I have been cast in BILOXI BLUES, set for production January 19 - February 10...I won't have time to get away until March. Hopefully, I will return from vacation with lots of interesting stories, gossip and scandals!! Keep your fingers crossed...
