I'm thinking that I need a caffeine infusion to continue the day (it's now only 9:40am). I had a fun night (impromptu porch party), drinking and carousing. Plus, we have this cool event today at Noon. In honor of our classic film series starting tonight, we're shutting down the street and having a chariot race a la Ben Hur. Should be a hoot! I hope I get to wear a toga.
