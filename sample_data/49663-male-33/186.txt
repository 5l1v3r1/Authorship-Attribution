I am also interested to know anyone else's celebrity cruising/flirting stories. Maybe we'll get some fun tidbits to share. Mind you...any mention of cute guys may send the author's boyfriend into a jealous tizzy, but it's a risk I am willing to take...since he's my very own "Joey"...his name is actually Joe...not Matt...I just did that to protect his anonynonynonynonyminity....uh....privacy. Anyhow...the secret is out. This is him:  urlLink Joe . Isn't he cute? Kinda Carson Daly-ish, doncha think? Anyhow.....bring 'em on!!!
