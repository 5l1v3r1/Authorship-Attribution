I had a terrific evening with Matt! I picked him up at the airport as scheduled. I arrived a few minutes early and watched from the observation deck. There's something really quite pretty about the airport at dusk. I watched his jet land, and then taxi. I met him at the gate, and we chattered the rest of the walk to the parking garage. When we got to the car, a more proper welcome home was exchanged. :)  He played Alisa's CD for me - she's an excellent cellist (the person he was visiting in NYC). We had a late dinner at Luchita's, and then I drove him back home. I did finally get to see the interior of the dorm room. What a flashback! It was with much difficulty that I tore myself away from his beautiful lips...and drove back to Aurora.
