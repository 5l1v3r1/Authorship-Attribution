OK, OK...so I was a little wound-up when I wrote that last post. Forgive me. It's been a wee bit stressy around unextraordinary.com these past few days...our host was hacked, bumping us offline for 3 days, and I wanted to get on and update the whole court situation. AH well...   Friday, I was seated on a jury for a minor traffic offense trial. The charge was minor, but the trial was fascinating. The City of Cleveland had the burden of proof, and we as the jury, felt very strongly that they did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the verdict was  not guilty . I enjoyed my time listening to and deliberating the case. I still stand behind my statement that the system is clunky and needs streamlining and have already submitted several suggestions, like...give each member of the prospective jury pool a pager...which would allow them to be anywhere within a 10 mile radius of the courtroom. People could go to work (if it was close enough) or shopping or to the library... anything  but sitting in that little room for 8 hours. You would have 30 or 45 minutes to report back to the court, and if you didn't, you'd be found in comtempt.  Anyhow...it's good to be back...
