urlLink Not So Gay Times, by Norma Sherry - Democratic Underground   We are living in frightening times. Were in a war without an end. Were in Iraq on a lie. We have a runaway deficit that promises to get worse if we dont alter our course. We have more Americans out of work than in anytime in previous history. We have lost jobs well never regain to lands and workers far from our shores.   We have lost seven of our ten Bill of Rights. We are on constant alert for dangers untold and unknown. We have record numbers of illiterate citizens. We have hungry children, abused children, and fatherless children in numbers nearly incalculable. We have new names for old groups and old groups disguised as new. Bigotry, Anti-Semitism, and a lack of civility are at all-time highs.
