my big gay life (9)    what can I say? It's Friday and life is good! It's time, once again, to go back to the theatre tonight to perform the concert to a sold-out house. Maybe we can insert some sort of Latin/Mexican number into the show in honor of  Cinco de Mayo.  And, no, I won't be wearing any fruit baskets on my head. I guess it's safe to assume that my ass will be in the studio a lot this weekend. This recent validation of our work is going to kick us into high gear with our writing, production and post. So, I guess it's a good thing that I don't have any boyfriends clamoring for my time right now. Funny the way the Universe works, huh?
