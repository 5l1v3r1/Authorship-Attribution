Well, so much for the 13th sunny day of the year here in Cleveland! It now looks like monsoon season might still be upon us. I took Toby for a walk at Huntington Park in Bay Village today. We watched the dark clouds roll toward us from out over Lake Erie. Right now, it looks like it's dark enough outside to be 9pm. Weird. I am going to head over to the hospital to visit with Granda. Yes, she's still in, but she is slowly getting better. Anyway, don't forget to watch the Tony Awards tonight!
