I spent most of yesterday just as squirrelly as ever...not sure why. I am so happy to finally be at home and sleeping in my own bed! Last night's performance was great...we even had a last minute replacement for Go To Hell Kitty, who was in the hospital recovering from a nasty asthma attack. So, the swing went on...and did a great job! Ricki (some men just can't hold their arsenic) brought her boyfriend  urlLink Connor  to the cast party. He's an absolute doll And a rising popstar in Europe. Such a sweet guy & very talented...or so Ricki tells me. Today will be all about catching up on laundry and relaxing here at 5216 Bridge.
