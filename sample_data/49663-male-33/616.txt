Thankfully, today passed in a flash. From the enormous settlement for  The Music Man , to the meetings today with several media companies, I'm a bit drained. But, what is this...a bitch and moan weblog? Hardly! I have a choir rehearsal this evening which is sure to boost my autumn blahs. We've been working on 18th Century music with some very sophisticated vocal arrangements. Funny how singing gets the endorphines going. I am hoping to make more major progress on my book assignment...maybe even finish reading that sucker tonight. Then, of course, there's the writing of the actual review. If I would just hunker-down and do it, I wouldn't have to be spending our time yapping about it. Forgive me.
