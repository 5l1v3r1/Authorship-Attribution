Too bad my recent urges to Blog have been thwarted by the broke-down tech at Blogger. Anyhow, the past few days have been interesting and amazing. I spent Tuesday doing a press junket with Ann-Margret and Gary Sandy, both starring in the current national tour of Best Little Whorehouse in Texas. Both of them have been terrific to work with, and are wonderful in the show. I've been knee-deep in Munchkins this week...what with OZ rehearsals in high gear. In any case, I expect to be back blogging in short order.
