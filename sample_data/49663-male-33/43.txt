I went to the Tremont Arts & Cultural Festival today in Lincoln Park. Besides the grayish day, everything was perfect! I had a wonderful time visiting with people from the neighborhood. I ran into Hottie Jon from across the street...he's sporting a pretty healthy/hairy goatee these days. Apparently, he's back in his MBA program. He invited me to come over whenever I wanted...but Sundays were especially good. Weird, no? I spent a lot of time over at the City of Cleveland Kennels booth playing with puppies and the cute guys hanging around them. I am so bad! Nice to know there are always opportunities, I guess. Right now, I'm going to a cook-out/bonfire down in the wilds of Medina County with Margaret. It's at the home of our friend Laurie. It sounds like a really fun way to spend an autumn evening. Don't know when I'll be back to post, so for now...be well...and most importantly...DON'T behave.  Peace.
