So I talked to Matt. He got home from school and left a message on my cell phone. So I called him back. He really didn't have anything to say, but he asked if he could call me back in a little while...which he did. We just chatted about daily stuff...nothing much, actually, and he left to go have dinner. He's got a history exam tomorrow, so tonight will be a studying frenzy. Okay...
