Ha!  (Tongue planted firmly in cheek)  I'm still here. Final rehearsals are going well. The orchestra quit two nights ago - in what was one of the biggest and dumbest diva-fits I've ever seen. Apparently, the issues are all ironed-out now and we have them back. Whatever. I'll show 'em what a REAL diva-fit looks like if they just don't sit down, shut-up and play their friggin instruments. Oh, and by the way orchestra freaks...I play the title role...and your bitch-asses better start showing some respect!  LOL. Things I've learned:   1. Glucose-based stage blood smells like cherries but tastes like barf.   2. Strobe lighting mounted 12 inches above your head can induce seizures even if you're not epileptic.   3. There is nothing glamorous about taking your bow drenched in stage blood ( a la  Carrie )   4. Convulsing and writhing in pain whilst crucified on the cross will draw gasps of awe from the audience.   5. I look good in my Jesus-diaper loincloth.
