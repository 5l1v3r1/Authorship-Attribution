Not much new to report on the boy-front. Kelly and I made a quick trip to the store tonight to satisfy some sort of feeding-urge. Hers was sweet...mine, salty. I ended up getting some barbeque flavored SOY NUTS (very yum) and she decided on some Gummi letters of the alphabet. I never liked anything Gummi...including the bears. Jelly candy just doesn't do it for me.
