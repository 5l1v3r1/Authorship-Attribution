The meeting went exceptionally well! Little to NO outbursts, if you can believe it! We muddled through it in a little less than three hours, which should make the Annual Meeting a breeze. In other news, Trish comes back today and I can't wait to talk to her and catch up on EVERYTHING. She's been in St. Lucia with her boss, so I'm sure she wasn't getting any SUGAR...or into ANY mischief for that matter.
