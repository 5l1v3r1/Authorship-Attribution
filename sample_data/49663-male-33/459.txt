Okay, since it's now 11:15am the day after, I'm  really  glad the big gay prom is over. Kelly and I have decided to go for an invigorating 8-mile hike today. I can't think of a better way to spend this beautiful afternoon. Thanks to everyone who sent their greetings this weekend...it meant a lot. Look for more  my big gay life  installments coming soon.
