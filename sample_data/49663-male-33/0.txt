Well, Pop Goddess BRITNEY SPEARS is in town tonight...shaking her illicit and tampered rack around the stage. is she just a giant hootchie, or is there some redeeming quality that I am missing completely? A friend of mine called yesterday...YESTERDAY, people....wanting tix to Miss Brit's SOLD-OUT show. Nothing like waiting til the very last minute. "Oh, I'll just call Todd and get tix thru him." Well, the last time I checked, my name wasn't Ticketmaster...and if it was, I'd be pissed about not getting any of those "convenience" fees. Granted, I am a miricle worker when it comes to scoring tix. I have connections all over the place...and probably (if I really wanted to) I could get her the tix. But, right now, I am feeling a little cranky. So, excuse me.
