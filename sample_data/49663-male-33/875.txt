don't feel like you have to perform... just talk  ...   That was one of my lines from the script of  A Chorus Line . We finished up the run  this past weekend. I was sad to see it end, but not for just the usual reasons. No, this time there was more. ACL was the place I went every night this summer while Grandma was in the hospital and in hospice...it was my escape and my relief. Of course I miss my friends from the show, and will continue to see them, but there is always that sense of finality...a parting of ways...like breaking up.   But there are new diversions and relationships to explore and develop, and I am excited about what new things are in store. I remain resolute about returning to blogging. I managed to miss my August 10 Blogaversary...I'm three years old now! I feel like grandpa in a pack of excited/slick up-and-comers...but I am so thrilled to see blogging  finally  take off 'round these parts. There are some amazing Clevebloggers...I would suggest clicking on that Brewed Fresh Daily link to visit a few. Check them out...they're really wonderful, some of them...
