Okay, so I missed a day yesterday. The problem here is this: our internet connection completely and totally sucks! Yes, we have a T1 line...but for some inexplicable reason, our system gets REALLY bogged-down & then Blogger doesn't want to work...what's a girl to do??  Did anyone else hear the NPR review of THE GRINCH today? Yikes! It totally slaughtered the new Jim Carrey flick. Not really surprising...he's a hack!
