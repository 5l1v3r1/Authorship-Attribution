Wow...incredible week. I owe you all an update (or two or three) at least! Work has been insane, but  good  insane...if there is such a thing. I had some more PR with actors from  AIDA  and one of them, Eric, was a total delight (not to mention handsome). He used to work at Disney with Kristen Willets (now married to Backstreet Boy Kevin Richardson) and Chris Judd now Mr. J-Lo. He indicated that Chris wasn't always necessarily interested in women. My ex-sweetie Lee phoned this week and we had a brief chance to catch-up...he's doing well, slogging thru his residency in Miami and hanging out with his cousin. My best friend Trish arrives in town later this evening to hang out...so I'm really geeked about that! We finally had an amazing lake effect snowstorm last night...and this morning...it's beautiful and unexpected. They tell us it'l be gone by Sunday. Powder is nice while it lasts. Let's see...I'm going to a conference in Charleston, South Carolina in mid April, followed by little more than a week in NYC in May, and several possible trips to Puerto Rico, SF, LA and Ft. Lauderdale. Yikes! Busy season is upon me! Well, hope all is well where you are. I'm heading into the third consecutive sold out week of JCS and can't wait to see all of you at the theatre. I will have CD cast recordings and also videos if you out of towners want to marvel....lol   :::kiss kiss:::
