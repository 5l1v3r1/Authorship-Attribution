Again, general weirdness on the former set of  Biloxi  last night. As the new set gets built over the remains of the old one, it just keeps reminding me about that show.Okay, I'll quit harping about it...it's just weird, okay? My friend Jen wants me to come visit her in the UK this weekend. So, I am going to go check fares...just to humor her. Be back later...
