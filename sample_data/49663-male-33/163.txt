I am going to see/hear a faculty recital this evening with Matt. The parents of his best friend will be performing at Kulas Hall tonight at 8pm. Since these people are his surrogate family...it'll basically be like meeting the family. And me with little to no knowledge of classical music...I guess I'll have to rely on my charm and good looks (don't FAIL me now!)
