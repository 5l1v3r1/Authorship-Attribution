Pomade...   I should have known! This morning, I was running late...disastrously late. I nearly somersaulted down my steep and shallow staircase, slid across the hardwood floor and knocked my head into the downstairs bathroom doorframe. What a great way to start the day. The typical end to my morning ablutions is the application of some hair product, be it gel, wax, mud or pomade. Today, I couldn't find any of my regular products, so I reached for this random and unassuming tube of gel, dispensed some into the palm of my left hand and vigorously applied it to by beautiful chestnut locks. The gel quickly cemented my hair into a dazzling retro-swoop...like the "up" part of a pompadour, but with my very short sides. Spectacular! And, it was frozen in place to boot! Nothing except hot water and shampoo was going to unlock this puppy. As I scrambled out the door, I managed to catch the newspaper mid-fling from the paper boy without even stopping. Things were looking up! Then I realized...I was using Billy Flynn's pomade...the very gel I used through the entire run of  Chicago . No wonder I have my sh*t together today! You go, Billy!     All I care about is love...
