my big gay life [19]   What is the musical theatre coming to? Last night at auditions for  Chicago , there were no gay guys to speak of. I mean, what's the point of doing musical theatre if there are no cuties around? The once exclusive territory of my tribe has now given way to untalented, unattractive hetero men with prostate problems. I ask you, where is the justice in this world? Anyway, I go back tonight to help out with round 2 of auditions, with callbacks on Wednesday night. At the very least, it keeps me out of trouble. This is a big week in my  big gay life ...what with the final few days of my twenties dwindling down. I face the big 3-0 with a little trepidation. I know that with the support of my friends (and a Gin & tonic) I'll be fine. Turning 30 is not so scary, it just seems that way. Maybe turning 30 doesn't necessarily equal death in the gay community. Maybe I don't have to plan to live out my days in my house overgrown with ivy and bushes...and with 36 cats running around.  [must shake thought from head ]    Note to self: go back to Outfitters to see hunky instructor-guy.
