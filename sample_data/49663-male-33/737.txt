wade into the river    I'm sorry I didn't say anything sooner. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted to say to you...    Last Wednesday, July 24, one of my grandmothers died...Grandma Stuart. My mother phoned me in New York to say that she had passed quietly away in bed at 11 that morning. The reason I didn't know what to feel or what to say has to do with a deep family rift that occured well over twenty years ago...a rift that fractured our family, and ultimately split my father's siblings along a complicated and painful fault. How are you to grieve for about a person you barely knew? How do you mourn a shadow, a faint memory of someone significant? I don't have answers to those questions. I didn't know her...and I wished to have known her as an adult, that we might have talked and enjoyed each other's company.    There will be a memorial in August, bringing back together the family for the first time in decades. And while the years of hurt and anger won't just wash away, maybe we'll find some shred of something, some level-headed connection to help mend what is threadbare. Can we, together, span the crevasse? Rebuild a bridge that was burned long ago?  Connect ? I know that I am ready to wade into the river...and try.    Goodbye, Grandma. I have not seen you, I have not known you...but I have not stopped loving you.  I hope there is peace where you are...
