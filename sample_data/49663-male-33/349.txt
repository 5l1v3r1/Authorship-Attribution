Okay, I have a confession. I have been emailing this guy from my neighborhood for a week now and I haven't told you about it. I received a message last week from him, reintroducing himself to me. We have since started a remarkable correspondence. Besides being fantastically entertaining and having a terrific sense of humor, he's very handsome. So, each email I receive brightens my day...it's hard to describe. Anyway, I am captivated.
