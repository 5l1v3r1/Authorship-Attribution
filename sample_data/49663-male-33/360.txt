my big gay life (7)    Patrick's birthday party/ urlLink Queer As Folk  party was a lot of fun, although I wish the episode of QAF was better. I guess they all can't be incredible. Anyway, Adam was not there, so I did not get to flirt ruthlessly. But, the company was great...to be happy and laughing and generally not caring about my singledom, if only for an hour. So much for my big gay life, eh? I came home, talked and pet my dog, Toby until Trish called from Philadelphia. After our nightly conversation, I crawled into bed and crashed into dreamland instantly.
