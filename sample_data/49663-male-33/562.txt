Spent most of this weekend in a sweet delirium...running back and forth from show to show to show, visiting friends in blues bands, drinking too much and sleeping too late. One more show to go this weekend...I'll leave in 15 minutes, back to the land of Chi. I'm looking forward to a little slow-down...coming at me at 9:30 tonight, when I walk out of the stage door and blissfully toward home, rest and myself. O lovely quiet!
