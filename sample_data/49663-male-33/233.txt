I was telling Trish that I always encounter a certain sense of melancholy when I'm in the Baltimore airport. It stems back to a very wonderful/horrible period I went through with Lee as we were breaking-up. I visited his new home on a few occasions in Baltimore, and coming & going through that airport always brings back a tidal wave of old crap...okay, it's not really a tidal wave anymore...but I am always cognizant of it. The melancholy that creeps around corners and sidles up next to you when I'm there. And, I'm always there by myself, it seems. I both love it and hate it. I am always curiously drawn to it...as if I'll find some new information...or answers this time.
