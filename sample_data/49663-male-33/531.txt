my big gay life (37)      I am barely able to type this. My whole upper body is numb from a new workout designed especially for me by "Don" who is one of the trainer/consultants at my new gym. He assures me my upper bod will be wracked with pain tomorrow, but that I should be completely mobile again by Sunday. Ack! Well, I will say that I like my new gym a whole lot more than my old one...this one actually has helpful staff and lots of equipment. Don was impressed with my cardio stamina (ex-cross country runner here) but he noted very quickly that for all my endurance training...I am a blank canvas when it comes to weight training. Following Don's instructions to a tee, I came home and popped down some X...er...ibuprofen. Thus, we begin my journey. On my quick ride home, my thoughts turned to food, naturally. I thought it might be a good night for authentic Mexican. I guess we'll see who's up for some fun tonight....      That's it for now, kids...I'll be back later...feeling chatty.
