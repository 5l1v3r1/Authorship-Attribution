You know what was weird? Being on the set of my new show for the first time last night, and seeing the remnants of the  Biloxi  set...the paint marks, the spots on the floor where the bunks were...it was really strange...rehearsing the new show where the old one once stood. I had a decent rehearsal for  Getting Away ...not that everything's all peachy-keen...but definitely better than before.
