my big gay life [28]      Twenty-eight is my favorite number. No reason...I just like it. Anyhow...yesterday was a long one...so, by the time I got home at 8:30, I was ready for a cocktail or four. I rallied Kelly for a night out. We headed to the Market Avenue Wine Bar for a nice quiet, relaxing bottle of wine. However, by the time we had guzzled that into oblivion, we decided we needed to visit the Parkview Niteclub for Blues Jam. So, we headed over to the deliciously seedy nightspot in our neighborhood and took up residence near the bar. A high school friend of Kelly's was the featured performer. Kelly got completely (and enjoyably) schnockered, while I played designated driver. She flirted recklessly with a County Prosecuting Attorney (who clearly spent way too much on hair products) who, in the end, left without her number. When we arrived home near 1:00am, we played a lil Fleetwood Mac before heading off to bed. What a weird night...although fun!! Not very gay, but this is what happens sometimes. It can't all be glamour, glamour, glamour...but I can try.
