Fridays are good. My Friday has been all about catching-up on stuff, settling scores, etc. I am happy to report that the ex-love-of-my-life-now-best-friend Lee, is free and clear of his recent legal nightmare. A victim of domestic violence, he called the Police for assistance only to be thrown in the slammer with charges pressed against him. Eventually, all was set straight...except for Lee who is still perfectly gay. Tonight, I am performing in a 2-nighter fundraiser for the CVLT, where I recently completed my run in  Chicago . Hope you all have terrific weekends!
