Things:  I often see movies later than everyone else. Typically at 2:30am, I'll catch something I meant to see in the theatres month earlier. I just saw  urlLink The Mothman Prophecies  the other night...and I have to admit that I'm still a wee bit freaked out. I decided to read the non-fiction book the film is based on...and it's pretty freaky, too. Nothing like being creeped out at bedtime. Usually this just happens when I'm in a doomed relationship. Anyway.   One of my dear friends has lost another loved one to suicide. This is one of the most difficult losses someone can have...I know because I've lost two people this way. I wish there was something more I could say or do, but suicide always leaves everyone at a complete loss for words. There never is understanding...always the looming question mark. I knew her friend, and I adored her. While I didn't have much contact with her in the past few years, I will always remember her as a soft spark of happiness...warm and sweet and always moving. She was beautiful and loved.  Namaste , Wendy.   Where do we go from here?    I know my dear friend will weather this storm like she has so many others, but it just doesn't seem fair that she should have to. I know it's all for some higher purpose, but that doesn't create much solace right now. Any good thoughts and prayers would be appreciated.   As for me, I'm remarkably okay! Life and work and play are all at an enjoyable and manageable pace for the moment...and I can be nothing more than thankful.
