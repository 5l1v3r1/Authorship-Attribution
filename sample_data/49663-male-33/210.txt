So, we had a casting change in BILOXI on Monday. Chuck, our Carney, quit...citing complications and time issues with work. What ever . Last night, we are presented with our 4th (and hopefully final) Carney: David Kammerman. This is a stroke of genius, as David is an incredibly talented actor...we are really lucky to have him! My evening with Jennie was great. I mototred out to her parents' home in the middle of nowhere. It took less that 15 seconds to be transported right back to High School...we became these terrifying recreations of our 16 year-old selves...it was immensely fun!
