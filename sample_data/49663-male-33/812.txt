winter wheat    I've been given a tremendous opportunity to revise and revive the one-act thesis I wrote at OSU...the one in which my friend  urlLink Andrew  appeared. I expect that I will be able to improve the dialogue vastly, and add another act...develop the characters appropriately. Still, for what it was...I am still very proud of it. It's a dream to have the chance to breathe life into it once more.   Excerpt:    Kim : What about you?! What about  your  life?   Becky's ghost : There are no answers you'd understand. This isn't about my life. It's about you living  yours .   Kim : I've forgotten how.   Becky's ghost : No. You haven't. This is a new day. This is life. Hold it to your heart and never let it go.     Mrs. DeWine  (flashback):   There is a field across the street from the house where Becky grew up...  a field in which she imagined dreams...where she made memories to last her lifetime and beyond...  A field whithered and dead under the January snow...   The hope and promise of a spring yet to come.  The tiny green chutes burst through the snow, bringing with them new life...   The winter wheat grows...  Through the icy days, it grows...  The green, the life...      Becky's ghost : When the winter comes, and the field across the street turns green...   Remember me.
