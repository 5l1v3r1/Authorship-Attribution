Disaster struck a few minutes ago. I accidentally deleted my entire website. How, you might ask, would one do this? Very simply: I pressed the wrong button in my maintenence area. Imagine accidentally turning on your Insinkerator while it's full of spoons. You get the idea. After 30 minutes of rebuilding links, re-Bloggering, etc...we're back looking just about the same. I made the home page pics a little smaller, but everything else is the same...
