Coming up for air...   I survived the opening, and the subsequent cast party. After a few hours rest, it all started back up again today. In a few minutes I'll head down to the theatre to pick-up the star and head over for a television interview. I feel like I'm ready to collapse. I'm supposed to go to a church choir rehearsal tonight, and then I have a 6am call tomorrow for a series of live tv shots from the theatre. Calgon...take me away!
