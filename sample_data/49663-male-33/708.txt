I can't find my flashlight.   It was one of those Maglites...the ones that weigh 5 pounds  before  you load the batteries(I am certain they're made of lead). I think I must have cleverly filed it away somewhere during the move in December and can't unearth it now. I am looking for it because sometime in the past two weeks, my dryer vent has stopped venting to the outside of my house. I realized this when the basement was transformed into a rainforest during a drying cycle last week. There was  actual rain  in the basement from condensation forming on the cold water pipes. So, how do you fix something like that? Well, checking out the dryer vent tubing is a good bet...except it's helpful to have a flashlight. I've snaked it with a spare garden hose...from the exterior of the house and the interior. SO, I have no idea what to do next. However, in the search for my long lost flashlight, I found three hammers. How did I manage to accumulate  three  hammers?? And, it's not like they are 3 different sizes (which might be helpful sometime). So, if you are psychic...would you tell me where my flashlight is?
