gawd  could I be any more dull today? I have spilled coffee on my khaki shorts thrice this morning, and I'm in no shape whatsoever to speak to or be seen by other people. I have decided that Starbucks will be the reason I get thru this afternoon's show. How do you get thru the 7th show of the week? I mean, we're all exhausted and CRANKY! Then, there's the issue of what to do after the show...go out with cast? Go directly home? Why do I even care?
