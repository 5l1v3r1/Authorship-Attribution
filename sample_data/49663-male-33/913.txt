uh-oh it's January again...   [-] Fuck! It got cold and snowy again. I know, I know...I really shouldn't be surprised...living in Cleveland and all. Friday, I picked up the Vee-Dub from the dealership and I am happy to report that it has been whipped back into shape. When you spend that much money on maintenance, it's nice when you can actually notice a difference.  [-] Met up with the company of Jacques Brel that night and had a blast! I'm really looking forward to getting back on stage. Luckily, I will reprise many of the same material I did in my first run of the show...this turns out to be quite convenient, fun and  a major time saver!  [-] Saturday, Jeff and I went out to visit Dad who is home recovering from hernia surgery. He didn't luck-out, and had to have open surgery. He seems to be doing well and enjoying his painkillers.   [-] Sunday was reserved for some much needed work-related clothes shopping and our usual Sunday evening ritual: making dinner together and mindlessly relaxing in front of the tube watching HBO, Netflix or Tivo.
