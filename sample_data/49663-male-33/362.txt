my big gay life (6)    So, it's Sunday. Kelly's made a beautiful brunch for the both of us (brunch?! how gay is that?). I have to pop in to work for a few minutes and then the afternoon is free. I have proposed that we go bike riding in the park for two reasons: the health benefits, and the potential cute men who may also be riding today. We are also scheduled to visit with DVDave and gang for  urlLink Queer As Folk  night. Quite possibly, that lanky, tall, handsome Adam will be there. If so, I shall flirt ruthlessly.
