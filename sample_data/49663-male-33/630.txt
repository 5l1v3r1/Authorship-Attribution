Can I just tell you how much I enjoyed the hike tonight?! To my surprise, over 100 people showed up for the hike at the Oak Hill Trailhead in Peninsula...which happens to be just down the road from my Aunt & Uncle's farm. The twilight hike was programmed to demonstrate how the forest changes from day to night...the types of animals that come out, the different sounds...the way our eyes adjust perfectly. We had no flashlights or lanterns, but could find our way without trouble. At the end of the hike, the Harvest Moon was rising over the forest. It started out low in the sky, rotund and orange-yellow. Within fifteen minutes, it had gained significant altitude and was blazing white. One of my fellow hikers lent me her binoculars to get a closer look at our magnificent moon. The evening was punctuated by the presence of a couple of trail hotties of undetermined sexual orientation...not to mention Doug, a gift from the National Park Service...tall, dark and yummy. He's leading a Night Bike later in the month. Looks like I'm going to have to buy a headlight for my bike. Color me  there.
