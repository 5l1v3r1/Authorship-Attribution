Perhaps it's the violent nature of the show, perhaps it's the seething hell our rehearsals have become, or it could just be that I'm the biggest diva-bitch of all time (doubtful, but I can fantasize, right?)...but I hate this new show I am working on. Well, I don't hate the  show , I hate most of the people in it. Almost every single person is a talentless hack. They make me miserable. They're slow. They're insufferable. They're mediocre. I feel trapped...like a squirrel in a cage. I'm  dying ....
