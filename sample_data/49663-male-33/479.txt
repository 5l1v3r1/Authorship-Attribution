hello, again! Sorry it's been awhile since my last posting, but things have been crazy! My friend Trish is coming into town for a wild weekend of drinking & nsync-ing. Yes, it's that time again - time for us to make our annual pilgrimage to the NSYNC concert. Last year, the experience caused me to launch my blog...so the implications are enormous! In any case, i'll be thinking about you all & hoping you are well! I hope to post at least once this weekend. Have a great one!!
