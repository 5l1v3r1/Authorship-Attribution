things from today     [+] My Jetta is in the shop for its 60k service, plus a busted headlamp and oxygen sensor. My invoice will be at least $730, if not more. Feh! Tracy at VW said the   good news   was that they had all the parts and could get it all finished today.     hooray.     [+] I got a call today re: Jacques Brel. The time has come to do the show again. I will be joining the Huntington Playhouse cast for a run in May. I'm looking forward to revisiting the show...it's been 6 years since I did it the first time.  [+] I am getting an in-office massage today at 1:30. A massage therapist comes every few weeks to revive and refresh us here at work. Nice!  [+] I have so much project writing work to do for work that won't get done in our open-plan office environment. Know what that means? I get to take work home with me.
