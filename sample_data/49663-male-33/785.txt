Just sometimes, there is less to say. Back from a few days trip is always good for shaking up the psyche a bit. I'm not sure if it's the travel, the partying, the exhaustion or a combination of all three, but I always feel like I return to a familiar life that doesn't quite feel like the one I left a week earlier. It's kinda like looking through colored cellophane...everything is where it was...it just looks different. A bit unsettling, really.    Has anyone ever figured out why it's so easy to find boyfriends/girlfriends when you go on vacation?   For the first time ever, I managed to finish all of my holiday shopping well in advance of the holidays, and I must admit feeling a certain level of smug satisfaction mixed with the dawning horror that I feel like an adult when I pull crap like that.   One day in the office to catch up of five days of absence. I'm guessing that there will be 250 to 300 emails waiting for me when I open Outlook...pray for me. With any luck, it'll be a barrage of junk email solicitations for Viagra, home loan refinancing and penis enlargement...three things I am currently not interested in...
