So, today's challenge is to figure out a successful marketing & PR plan for (get this) VERIOVKA, The Ukrainian National Folk Dance Company. Okay...so how do I approach this one? Slam some ads in the Russian newspaper? Or do I simply toss a couple ads in The Ukrainian paper and hope that does the trick. I don't think any of my parents' country-club friends would be remotely interested in buying a ticket, so who am I supposed to sell 'em to???  College students? Teen Girlies?! I wish it would be that easy! "Buy a ticket to VERIOVKA and get a free NSYNC (fill in the blank) with every purchase. Man, we'd be sold-out right away. The only problem would be, no one would actually show up at the theatre for the performance. Once they got their free NSYNC thing, they'd be gandhi...you know what I am saying???   Let me know if you have any brilliant ideas...okay?
