damn, it's Monday...   What the?!? Wasn't it, like, Saturday the last time I checked? I spent yesterday running a few errands and keeping up with the gardening while my parents are on vacation. Little does my mother know, but I've managed to kill everything at my house except two pots of petunias. I think everything is safe...I am a competent waterer.   Yesterday, I went to see the movie  urlLink My Big Fat Greek Wedding , which was one of the most humorous and touching movies I've ever seen! If you haven't already, get your ass to the theatre and see it! And no, I didn't go see it because Joey Fatone is in it (for like, 20 seconds).
