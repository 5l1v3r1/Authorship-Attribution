So things are shaping up for my trip to Chicago this weekend. My center of operation will be the W Hotel, and I'm planning on seeing  urlLink Late Nite Catechism  (for work...really!) having Late Night Sushi with Andrew, Brandon and Cinnamon and doing whatever else seems fun. I've already said I am going to find the  urlLink Real World  house and have my photo taken in front of it (for work...don't ask).
