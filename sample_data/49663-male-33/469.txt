my big gay life (8)    I had a wonderfully relaxing dinner with Phil last night. Phil is one of my dearest and closest friends. He was the first person I came-out to...and he was the first person to take me to a gay bar and introduce me to lots of other gay people. So, we go  way  back. Anyway, I was able to fill him in on all the gruesome details of late, and he brought me up to speed with his life. Mostly, I can't repeat it here because he'd kill me and/or get arrested. This morning, I arrived at my desk to find an email from Joe waiting in my inbox. Well, let me tell you...this one was a  gem ! I think he may have been drunk. Saying how he wants to have another chance to get to know me, another chance at friendship, etc. All I can think is:   go away, psycho!   Boys are stupid. They leave you, then they want you back...well...I ain't a yo-yo.
