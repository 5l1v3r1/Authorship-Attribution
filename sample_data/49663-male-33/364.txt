my big gay life (4)       You know how I mentioned that whole internet thing? I find it sad to see my ex-boyfriends online so much. For instance, if I sign on to check various email accounts, I'll often see them on my buddylists online in gay chatrooms, or cruising personals...and it seems so weird to me. It's like they're out there looking for the next best thing...and they think they'll find it on the internet?! It boggles the mind, really. I think  okay, so you had me in 3-D, living color...and yet I wasn't enough. So now, you'd rather be cruising around in some ridiculous e-fantasy never finding what it is you think you want.   And then I just feel like they're all sad and pathetic.    Note to self: remove ex-boyfriends from buddy lists.
