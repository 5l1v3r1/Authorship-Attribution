From my girl, Lisa:   Hey Todd.   Yes, thank god I wasn't in that building....or near by.  Although, right now we are all very sad.  I personaly am completely nauseous...this is our city...our home. I still have friends that I have not been able to get in touch with. Richard called me from the hospital to let me know that he is there on Emergency trauma...all the doctors are staying put to help any patients that need care.  The hospital he works at is about 25 minutes outside of Manhattan.  They are (somehow) transporting people to every hospital possible...thousands are hurt or dead.   We are all in shock...frightened...it could happen again...this is truely a tragedy.  Talk with you soon,  Love you-  Lisa :)
