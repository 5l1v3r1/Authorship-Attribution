A few things...  1. In shock re: Columbia. Way back in 1981, it was this spacecraft that ignited my imagination and fascination with space flight. It also made me realize (early on) that astrophysics would probably not be my major.  2. Kelly's Hagan campaign reunion party was last night...so much fun!!!  3. Lion King's first ad hits tomorrow's paper. The madness begins...  4. I will be flying out to Salt Lake City next Saturday morning to meet up with my Ohno Zone team and other speedskating glitterati.  5. House/Dog sitting out here in the country for my friend Phil.   more later...
