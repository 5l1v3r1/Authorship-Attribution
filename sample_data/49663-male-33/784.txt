Point of note:   -do not light candles on the same table on which you plan to wrap gifts.  -do not panic when you lose control of your car in a horrific holiday snowstorm...ride it out like you're skiing.  -do not try to fake excitement at receiving the world's most hellacious gift from a well-meaning friend or relative (how else are they gonna learn?!?).  -do not listen to Christmas carols on Dec. 26. They all sound sugary and out of tune.  -do not laugh at your dog when his license and nametag get stuck in the heating grate over which he was sleeping and he wakes up strangling himself.
