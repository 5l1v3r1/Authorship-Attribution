This in an email from Matt just now:   hey baby... just wanted to say hi... i love you. i want you to know that, and remember it clearly :) im sorry i get so frustrated so easily.... :( talk to you soon... yours ..    My response:   dear Matt, first off (and most importantly) let me tell you that I LOVE YOU and I love you more every day that goes by...I love you so much sometimes it hurts (in a good way)   secondly, accept my apologies for my ill timing I always have the need to talk about things and forget (sometimes) there may be a better time and place and method   I'm looking forward to talking, baby.   I love you.   yours, me
