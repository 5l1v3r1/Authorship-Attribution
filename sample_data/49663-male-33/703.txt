So, things are good...just a bit busy. I'm in perpetual motion, going from office to home to rehearsal to home to bed and then again to the office. This, of course, doesn't leave much time for anything else. It's the kind of routine where having the chance to watch 15 minutes of television is quite a novelty, and where doing the laundry seems like a lovely idea since it's not part of the daily crush. In any case, things are well, and I'm looking forward to the big gala opening night this Friday.
