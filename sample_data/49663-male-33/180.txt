What a trip! Last night's holiday lighting thingy was a scream! We did the ceremony amidst a complete white-out blizzard. I felt like Jack Nicholson at the end of THE SHINING. Afterwards (because traffic was so snarled) a bunch of us went out drinking at Becky's (famous hole-in-the-wall bar). Wheeee! By the time we headed home, traffic had returned to normal..despite the 8 inches of snow that had fallen.
