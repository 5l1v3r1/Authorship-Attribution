God, it's August. Hello from a rather frazzled and over-caffeinated human being. Let's see, to summarize:   1. Work (pre-season, break-neck pace)  2. Hospice (Grandma's still hangin' in there)  3. Rehearsals (A Chorus Line is shaping up)  4. Everything else (overwhelming)   7LW has the week off, so I am having my nephew over for the weekend...a little family bonding time. I'm looking forward to doing normal stuff like seeing movies and playing miniature golf...anything to distract this tweaked-out brain.  ;)
