my big gay life (10)     the big gay prom: a wallflower winces    Into my life, enter a little melancholia. This weekend is the annual  urlLink HRC  Dinner. It has become known as "Gay Prom" because it's the big formal event of the year for the gay and lesbian community here in Cleveland. It also happens to be one of the biggest-grossing and most successful HRC dinners anywhere in the nation. Go figure. Anyway, it's the event where all of Cleveland's gay and lesbian glitterati and glitterati wannabes don their best duds and head downtown for a big fancy-schmancy evening. I've been once, when I was still on my weekly radio show  The Gay 90's ...and I was there more as a media personality. I guess this one just stings because I know Dan will be there & there was a time when we had planned to go together. I know it's probably stupid for me to feel that way, but I feel really left-out and left behind. I feel like the nerd who never got asked to the dance. Although, I won't be sulking at home with a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Oh no...I'll be performing in that theatrical extravaganza in Brecksville. Sad.
