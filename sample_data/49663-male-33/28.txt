I am thinking about road-tripping next weekend with Matthew. We're going to go to Philly (Philadelphia, for my foreign readers) to visit his family and friends. It seems so spontaneous and fun. Trish was gracious enough to offer us both a place to stay, even though it's not determined what Matt is doing at this point regarding lodging. Road trips are fun - especially if there are road games to play. We are also considering shooting over to NYC briefly to have dinner with Ali and her family. I'm not sure how big I am on that idea (sounds like a lot of traveling for one weekend). However, he is eager for me to meet his surrogate family. Matt is (as I write) on his way to Chicago to spend the weekend with a friend. I look forward to a weekend of rest and relaxation.
