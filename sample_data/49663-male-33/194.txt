So, backing up...the road trip to Utica was really nice! Matt and I left Cleveland at 12:30pm and drove across PA and NY to Utica. We arrived at 6:15...a mere five hours and forty-five minutes after our departure. This is great considering the Mapquest people said it would take over 7 hours. I guess they don't count on driving at 80 to 85mph. We arrived and checked in at our luxurious Red Roof Inn, and then drove to Ali and Vivian's apartment. We had a nice dinner and then hung out for awhile. On Sunday, we had lunch and then headed over to the concert venue. After a wonderful afternoon, we headed back out on the road to Cleveland. Only, this time, it took only five and a half hours...Needless to say, I was exhausted the next day.
