Word is, my friends David and Julie (they're secretly inter-office dating) are going to go as teen hootchie queen Britney Spears and her love slave, Justin Timberlake. This should be very interesting to see...as I have no faith in their ability to pull it off successfully. They're both Republicans, for God's sake...and Republicans are NOT cool. Republicans are typically the LAST people you'd wanna see with a bare midriff and afro-blonde hair.
