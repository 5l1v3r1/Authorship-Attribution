Yesterday, driving to work was absolute treachery...black ice everywhere! For the uninitiated, black ice is a very thin layer that forms on roads, bridges and any other imaginable surface, and it always wreaks havoc to both drivers and pedestrians. So, imagine my amusement when I am approaching an intersection and I see a Police "Traffic Control" vehicle slide right through the red light while spinning counter-clockwise! Now  that's  what I call traffic control! Today, it was almost 50 degrees Farenheit...balmy! Spring-like! Almost...delightful. A little reprieve in the dark, dark, darkness of winter.
