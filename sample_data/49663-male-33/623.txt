My day is half over...I've managed to keep my eyes open with the help of a few strong cups of java. I arrived at the Palace this morning at 5:45. Alone, I walked the stage and out into the darkened house. It took just a few minutes for my eyes to adjust to the dim light thrown into the house from the ghost light on stage. The chandeliers were dark, the sconces black...only oddly-shaped shadows loomed in the space. When the stagehands arrived and turned on the houselights, chandeliers and sconces, the shadows retreated and the stage came to life. This was all in preparation for a live TV shoot. One by one, the handful of sleepy actors and stage managers arrived to appear on live television, talk, sing, dance...and yes...even play trombone...all in the hopes of selling a few tickets. So, at this point in the day, I feel like having lunch.   Last night, I escorted Gerritt VanderMeer, the actor playing Harold Hill, to the WEWS studios for a live television news interview. He reminded me what gracious and grateful actors are like...sweet, thoughful and genuine. He may not be a household name at this point...but keep your eyes peeled...I am certain you'll be seeing more of him.
