My sleeptime bliss was shattered this morning by the scraping and whining of the garbage truck. Today is not garbage day, I thought. But maybe today IS garbage day...maybe it's time to throw out all the old, to make room for the new. So, I think I am going to start chucking things left and right. From my old Weeble-Wobbles set to my shampoo...it's ALL garbage. Less is more, right?! Right! So, off you go...get cracking! Just throw it all out! My advice: keep any pets or loved ones, they're MUCH harder to replace in the event you need them. Maybe every day should be garbage day. I need to simplify and declutter my life. That will be a new mission from today forward: no more squirrelling away unneeded papers and objects....THINGS.  We'll see how long THIS lasts.
