urlLink Bush Supports Cohabitation of Unwed Lovers, by David Rothschild - Democratic Underground   As I was thinking about Bush's drive for a Constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, I became intrigued with a question that is never asked: what should two gay people do, if they do not get married?   Conservatives always argue about what gays should not do: they should not be able to marry, adopt, share benefits, visit each other when they are sick, have power of attorney, inheritance rights, joint custody, sex, or any of the multitude of things that constitute a heterosexual marriage.   Yet, conservatives never give good advise about what they should do: continue to live as unmarried lovers, attend religious conventions and be healed, be imprisoned, or be publicly branded? If conservatives are going to fight against marriage for gay families, they need to offer alternatives.
