I was interviewed on a morning radio show today, which was broadcasting live from the Palace Theatre (one of the theatres where I work). We talked about ghosts and hauntings and fun stuff like that...the interview was terrific...which made getting up so freakin' early kinda worth it. Matt called me no fewer than 10 times between last evening and this morning. Seems like he really wants to talk to me...which is good...because   we need to talk . Those dreaded four words...
