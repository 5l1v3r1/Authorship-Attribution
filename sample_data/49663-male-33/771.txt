where is angelique silva?    Today, after a particularly grueling day at work, I arrived home to an odd bundle of garbage strewn about in my yard. It was in the section back near Bridge Court, a quaint red brick alley that runs directly behind my house. At first, I thought the neighborhood dogs had managed to drag a whole trash bag out of the can, but as I approached, it looked more and more like... homework.  The bag was, in fact, a black backpack which had been torn, leaving the workbooks and papers scattered around. I don't understand how the backpack came to be there, but I gathered up all the papers and books and the tattered sweatshirt and piled them onto my side porch. The homework papers and quizzes revealed that the bag and its contents belong to Angelique Silva. From the looks of it, Angelique is in 4th or 5th Grade, and is an  excellent  speller. She achieved a 32 out of 32 on this week's quiz. Nonetheless, I wonder what has become of her, because, by the looks of her belongings...she was either really pissed off, or her bag was stolen. At any rate, I hope she's alright...
