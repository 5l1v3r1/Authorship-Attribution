urlLink  EMeRGe   Mailbag!  This email is from Singapore:  Todd, you goofy freak. Why do you post all your stuff in the public domain?    Hmmm...good question. I don't know. I guess it's much more thrilling to have strangers read my random babblings, than no one at all. Thanks for the email...and don't worry...no one's laughing at you. Honest. ::: snicker :::
