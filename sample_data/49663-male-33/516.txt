This weekend, I'm house & kitty-sitting for my parents who are going on a lil vacation. I always look forward to heading out to the old Stuart estate in lovely Aurora, Ohio, because it's way out in the middle of nowhere and because a change of venue is almost always a good thing for a few days. Other pluses include a fully-stocked refrigerator and liquor cabinet and access Mom and Dad's cars so I don't have to put more miles on the trusty Jetta...I like to give it a vaca sometimes, too. So, I get to go spend quality time with Emmi (the cat) and eat/drink my parents out of house and home. What else? Oh...over 97% of the respondents believe that the James Taylor concert was, in fact, a date. Thanks to everyone who emailed! In other news, I will keep you updated on the current sales progress of  urlLink NSYNC's  new album  Celebrity . Everyone is biting their collective nails wondering if it will top last year's record-breaking sales. I haven't slept in 3 days...
