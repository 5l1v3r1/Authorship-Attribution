:::snapping back into reality:::   Did you make any resolutions? Sorry, I promised myself I wouldn't ask anyone that question. you don't have to answer. I thought I might suggest some anti-resolutions:  -smoke even more or start smoking if you're a non-smoker  -eat things high in polyunsaturated fats  -have 3 martini lunches  -swear at your co-workers
