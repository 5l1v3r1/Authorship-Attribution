Well, I got some info on MYSTERY DAVID! I TOLD YOU I would hear this week, and I did! Marc called and said he was sorry for earlier confusion (see: Circus of Embarrassment, posted Sept. 13) regarding the WRONG DAVID. However, the David I was interested in is named DAVID BROGAN (sp?) who, he believes, is currently dating someone. He said that David had my number and would call me.  No, really...that's okay...if you're not single, don't bother.   Anyway, the mystery unfolds. it will be interesting to see  if  he actually calls. I'll be sure to keep you updated.
