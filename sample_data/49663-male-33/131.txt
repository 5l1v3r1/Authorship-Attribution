Back on Wednesday...October 18, our flight was delayed leaving Cleveland. Not because of anything here, but because of weather in New York. At any rate, the net result was this: our flight arrived at 8:10pm and I missed my show. However, what displaced this disappointing turn of events, was a bit or writing which consumed me on the delay, and eventual, flight over. I will share bits of it here with you.
