neglect.  I have not abandoned you. Life gets wicked busy sometimes...and blogging gets pushed a little to the side. A lot of time goes into maintaining the  urlLink Ohno Zone ...which has now become the premiere fan site for Olympic shorttrack speedskater, Apolo Anton Ohno. In any case, life continues on in lightling speed. I'm back in the studio with Doug, Kathy and Joni working on finishing some old stuff and working on new mixes for The Sissy Show for the upcoming tour.
