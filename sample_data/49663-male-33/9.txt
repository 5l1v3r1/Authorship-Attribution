I have a lot of ties. But my favorite one. My favorite tie is owned by the evil and nefarious overlord known as Melvin. The tie itself is spectacular: a deep grapey purple with flecks of blue and green. It is quite spectacular, but he won't let me have it. He (Melvin) does not wear ties. He refuses to. He wears nothing but argyle sweaters and oddly colored trousers that mostly don't match. The tie of my dreams hangs in his walk-in, next to 200 other ties he doesn't wear.  Just think of the rapture, the joy...the unmitigated happiness of my life if I owned this brilliant tie. I think I may just have to snatch it from him, although he'd know it was me, immediately because 1. He knows I worship the tie, and 2.  I might have access to it. So, until I decide what I'm doing about the world's best tie, I am not going to wear any of mine. I'll leave them in a jumble on the floor of my closet. No tie-straightening until I get Melvin's prized tie.
