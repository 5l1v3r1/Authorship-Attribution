Other news of note: I got my hairs cut...short!! Don't worry, I got it approved by my director first! It looks as though I may spend some time with Doug tonight, working on music. Tomorrow, a bunch of us from work are going to go see Eric Bogosian at the Ohio Theatre. We're meeting at 6:30 for drinks, and then the show. Sunday, I have tech. rehearsals for my show, so keep your fingers crossed. I hope you all have a terrific weekend! I may be back to post an update....
