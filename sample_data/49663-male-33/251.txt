Andrew and I finally had the chance to catch-up last night. In true old-school OSU style, we chatted into the wee hours of my morning...he's an hour behind. Anyway, it was good to splatter each other with the varied detritus from the past 4 or 5 years of our lives. I am fairly convinced to just sell the house and move to Chicago. What I'll do is another story...but I'll figure it out eventually. Anyone wanna buy a house?
