my big gay life [25]    Quite glamourously, I spent Saturday night  in  for once, discussing Charlie's Tony Awards outfit. He's going to look spectacular, I tell you! But, don't take my word for it...ask Fran Weissler! Anyhow, yesterday was really a lot of fun. Some old castmates from  The Wizard of Oz  and I made an appearance at the  Relay For Life  in costume. I never thought I'd be wearing that 40-pound hunk of metal ever again...but it was for a great cause, and we actually had a great time. I was worried, however, about rusting-up for real...it was misty/rainy all afternoon. I don't know if there's anything  gayer  than dressing in Wizard of Oz getup...do you? Okay, so you're wondering if I'm going to mention anything more about all my date requests this week...no. Today, I have to do the mundane shit: grocery shop, laundry, clean...etc. I also have a rehearsal for  Chicago  which will cause me to miss the Tony Awards...am I in danger of having my card revoked by missing the Awards? Can I do any Gay extra credit assignments? Should I kiss a buncha boys? Alphabetize my showtunes?
