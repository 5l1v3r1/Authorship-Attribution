Just like when my old friend, Bruce Hornsby said "that's the way it is..." I find myself in a quiet blissful place. Nothing too snazzy, nothing too exciting or happy going on, just calm and steady...it's just the way it is. And it feels good. Nothing makes me happier than to feel like I've got both feet firmly planted in the soil...heart open wide...and a fresh take on life.  These are the days we remember . Indeed. Maybe turning 30 this week gains me new perspective, like turning a corner to see a whole new block laid-out before you. I don't know what's ahead for me, but it looks like a long and interesting road. I hike on toward my horizon, smile firmly planted on face...whistling a happy tune.
