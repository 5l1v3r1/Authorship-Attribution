Well, it looks as though I'm a single man again. Joe got back from Spain...and rather than me launching into the "we need to talk" speech...he did. Which, is really quite surprising given his continual and recent (up to this past Friday) utter adoration. He said he'd done some thinking while in Spain, and thought that maybe we shouldn't be together romantically.  I had thought we had issues surrounding sex -  like not having any   (which certainly is major) but his sudden change of heart was a bit surprising and disappointing. So, I am, indeed, saddened by our break-up, but I realize it is for the best. Sometimes you run into a wall of insurmountable differences. Send me a hug or two, if you think of it. If you experience a sudden change in atmospheric pressure...don't worry...it's just me attempting to re-inflate my self-esteem. LOL  Ah...l'amour...
