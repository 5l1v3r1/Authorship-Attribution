Rehearsed "My Death", "Marieke", "Carousel", "If We Only Have Love", "Brussels", "Marathon" and "Old Folks".  Notes: The theatre is freezing cold. Cast seems vocally able. Nice to relearn old favorites. I'm enjoying singing again. The show was one of my grandmother's favorites, so I am especially happy to be doing it.
