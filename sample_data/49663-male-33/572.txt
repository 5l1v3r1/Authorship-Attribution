Again, last night, we're apparently the funniest goddamned show on the planet. For the second Friday in a row, we had the most hysterical audience...they laughed...no guffawed at  every thing. Sometimes I just don't get it. I had a weird show...the audience loved it, but I felt like I was just a step behind everyone. I hate when that happens...kinda feels like medicine-head...all floaty-like. I guess I should stop taking K before the show.
