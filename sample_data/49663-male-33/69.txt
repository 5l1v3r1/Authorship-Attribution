Terrific day, really. Spent a few hours with my family and extended family out in the country. Then, I raced back home to accompany Kelly to Thanksgiving in September, an annual dinner given by one of her closest friends, Julie. The food was wonderful,  but the turkey is making me quite sleepy. I am still attempting to finish my laundry started yesterday. Have been asked out on a date by Matt - a handsome and quite charming student at the Cleveland Institute of Music. My only qualms revolve around his age. He is 21 or 22...I raise an eyebrow...
