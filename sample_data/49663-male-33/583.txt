I managed to recover from the early morning yesterday...when I finally woke up this morning...I did miss Keith's going away party, I hope he'll forgive me. Today, I lounged around in my pajamas until around 11:30. I decided I'd better get outside while it was dry and sunny and mow the lawn (maybe one last time). Seeing as the weather was so fantastic, I took my bike and went for another 25-miler on the Towpath Trail in the heart of the  urlLink Cuyahoga Valley National Park . It didn't seem as long this week. The bonus this time was seeing a coyote. I startled it in a remote section of the trail. He was drinking from the river when I rode by. He skittered across the water and up the other embankment. He was a mottled red and gray...looking exactly like a picture at the ranger station I visited at the end of my ride. This evening, I went to the Weber Family annual Clam Bake...and there's nothing better on a crisp Autumn night!! Tomorrow is  urlLink Palooza , so I get to go into work...joy.
