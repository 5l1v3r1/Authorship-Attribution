From  Uncle John's Bathroom Reader : As if it's not bad enough to have a ghost haunting your office, a computer factory in England, built on the site of a 19th century chapel, is reportedly inhabited by a ghost that farts. Workers think it might be the embarrassed spirit of a girl who farted while singing in church. "On several occasions," said an employee, "there has been a faint girlish voice singing faint hymns, followed by a loud raspberry sound and then a deathly hush."
