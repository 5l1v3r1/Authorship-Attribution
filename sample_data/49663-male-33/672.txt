reluctant saviour    I was offered, and I accepted, the role of  Jesus  in Andrew Lloyd Webber's  Jesus Christ Superstar , slated to hit the Cleveland stage in March. It's funny to me, partly because I'm not particularly religious, and partly because my first legit show was  JCS  back in 1988...when I played Peter. That show was responsible for some of my most significant friendships to date. I met Phil and Deidra and many other who have remained in my life since then. So, here I am all these years later, set to play the title role...a role I never imagined would be mine. What I love about the show is the incredibly raw score...it screeches and rumbles, it bellows and jams...nothing else sounds quite like it. And yet, it is a demanding and taxing show on everyone...the kind of show I love best as a performer. I'll be sure to post details as I get them, and of course, notes from along the way...
