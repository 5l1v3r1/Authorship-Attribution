Oh yeah...I forgot to mention: all of us in "C Company" in BILOXI have to do a shitload of real-time actual Army-type push-ups. So, I have begun a new regimen I will call "Boot Camp" (wish it was Booty Camp...but that's another story) where I am doing push-ups, sit-ups and jogging to prep me for the role. Today's efforts, while valiant, were meager...so I won't reveal how few push-ups I did before I quit. However, tonight and tomorrow AM I will try to improve upon that number. Eventually, I need to be doing 100 in a single session. Yikes!
