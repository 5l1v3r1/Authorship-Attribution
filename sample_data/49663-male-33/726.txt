from seven this morning   Toby lept across the sealcoated drive toward the wet morning grass and in one swooping, giant loop, made his way back to the passenger-side of the car and lept in without effort. I'd packed my things last night in order to ease departure and reenter my life in the city and at work, and to finally see my house for the first time in five days. I had mixed feelings about leaving. Given the circumstances, I would never have expected to have so much fun spending time. Certainly, parts of it were difficult...both emotionally and physically, but his daily progress was a true inspiration and a reminder about simple gifts and quiet miracles. I left him in a better place than when I first took over a primary caregiver...he's bounced back to his old self, while ready to leave some of it behind...a little at a time.     It's almost 10am and I'm flying through piles of paperwork and unanswered emails...astounded at how fast everything returns back to the way it was...  a restoration of my simple and comfortable routine.       Well, at least for today.
