today totally  bites . okay, maybe not  totally ...but pretty close. I mean, I did get a ton of work completed: managed to get major press coverage of a workshop, executed a television interview with our CEO, booked press for  LIDO  this week and dealt with  Bullsh*t  from the ultra-witchy FAME Company Manager (she's a nasty old hag). Ugh. However, the good things do outnumber the bad today, so it isn't a  total  wash. I have been pitching stories to the media about  LIDO  for weeks and it seems they've finally bitten. I scored 5 radio appearances and one television booking for tomorrow and Friday...and it all happened today...in the midst of my little universe exploding.  It's all good ...
