I wrote this really  sweet  post yesterday...it was really very detailed, and quite lengthy...about my weekend. But then...Blogger  ate  it. Vanished into the ether  never to be recovered. If I have the time and the will, I shall try to recreate it and post it. Otherwise, my weekend will remain a mystery to all of you.
