God, it's been way weird 'round here lately...all trippy and busy. With Jim's departure, we're all catching the slack. Plus, we're putting THE LION KING on sale in a few days, which is more work than you might have thought. In the midst of all of this, I've been promoting a wildly successful run of  urlLink Sing-A-Long Sound of Music  which is a trip and a half. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and go! It's a cross between Halloween and the Rocky Horror Picture Show with a few beloved showtunes tossed in for good measure. Truly a riot! I had the pleasure of spending Tuesday with Charmian Carr, star of the original film (she was Liesl, the eldest...16 going on 17). She was worth the 20 hour day I had!
