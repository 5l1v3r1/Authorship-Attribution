Reconnect.  What a wild week! I've managed to reconnect with no less than four friends from my distant and not-so-distant past. Something must be in the air. The most surprising was the sudden resurfacing of my childhood best friend, Ryan Lyden. I have written about him on this weblog back in 2001, hoping he might Google himself and find my post...and that's exactly what happened! So, after 19 years, we finally got the chance to talk and catch up. Also recently reconnected: Anne, Chris and Rich. It's been like finding a favorite lost toy.
