a purple haze...      I took some muscle relaxers last night to help ease the pain in my lower back (due to excess Scarecrowing). So, today, I woke in an absolute haze, feeling all floaty-like and slow. It seemed to help me sleep, but my back is still feeling sore. I hope it disspates by tomorrow...
