I spent the morning with a ghostbuster...rooting through old theaters and meeting ghosts. Sounds fun, eh? Apparently, when you die, you have free will...a choice of whether or not to cross into "the light." Mary Ann says it lasts for about 72-80 hours...and then it vanishes. There are lots of reasons people don't cross...but you get stuck here if you don't. The only way to cross again it to totally bogart someone else's light....like at a funeral home OR a medium like Mary Ann can create it. I know it all sounds totally cracked...but what the hey?
