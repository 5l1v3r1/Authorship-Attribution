my big gay life (34)   Well, today I'm officially one month into my 30th year...and so far, so good! I've managed to keep any laugh-lines, crow's feet and other facial maladies in check. Free as a bird and having a blast!! Yesterday, I managed to zip through a ton of work before heading out to a board meeting in Chagrin. Afterwards, I had rehearsal for Chicago. We've blocked and choreographed all of Act One, and Act Two gets done tonight. We're all having a great time with the show, and with each other. Can I tell you  one more time  about my dismay at the lack of homos in the musical theatre lately? It's discouraging. Where are they? Watching football? I'm way overdue for work in the studio. Doug should be back from California any time now, and we need to hit it hard. I haven't managed to write anything significant lately, a fact that is mirrored in my blogging activity. Forgive me, but I am going through a dry spell. I hope to be wet with inspiration soon enough. Also, Earthlink is still experiencing growing pains as Mail.com is upgrading their email servers. As of today, I still have no access to my archived email folders, thus, no  unravel in 58 . I hope we can get going with that soon...I'd really like to get it over with...
