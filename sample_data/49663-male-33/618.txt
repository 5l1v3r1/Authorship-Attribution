edge of a line       Where do I go when theres no left and no right?    How do I win with no one here to fight?   How do I know when youre lost and not found?   Why do I hear this echo when youre not around?      What do I do when theres no right and no wrong?   Where do I go when theres nowhere to belong?   Standing on a limb at the edge of a line   How do I love what isnt even mine?      If words could tell the story   Speak the truth, decipher you   And even though I know the answer   I have questions, too      If I was there, youd be somewhere away   If I could go anywhere at all, youd stay   I could only dream of your kiss or your sigh   But saying hello would only mean goodbye      What do I say when there are no words to speak?   How do I hide with no place to seek?   Standing on a limb at the edge of a line   Clutching at a heart thats not even mine      If words could tell the story   Speak the truth, decipher you   And even though I know the answer   I have questions, too      With so much confusion, its hard not to lose your way   Its hard not to lose   Its hard not to lose your way
