to Chicago and back...     Friday started very early, up at 6am and to the airport by 7:30am. Arrived at Midway a few minutes early, and took the train into the city. I had meetings with  urlLink The Joffrey Ballet  and an impromptu meeting and tour with the great folks who manage the  urlLink Chicago Theatre  (whose marquee you might recognize from this season's  Real World opening credits). After my work was completed, I met  urlLink Brandon  at the hotel and we headed out to meet  urlLink Andrew  and  urlLink Cinnamon  at Uncle Somebody's Hacienda Mexican restaurant before going to see Late Nite Catechism. The show was hilarious, and I'm looking forward to it opening here in Cleveland next year! Next, we had a great sushi dinner at Rise, and then I went to the hotel and collapsed into blissful sleep. For a great rundown of our activities,  urlLink read Andrew's account and see the pics!  It's entry #350.
