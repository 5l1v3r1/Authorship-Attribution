Today was one of those autumn days to see in magazines or movies. Where the day is alternately crisp, clear and beatiful...and gray, chilly and the wind whips in across Lake Erie...seemingly from all directions. Almost as if it's not sure which direction to go, it lashes you, and circles back and lashes you again. The oppressive heat and humidity of late August has give way to the more temporal and indecisiveness of fall. The temperatures have fallen from the 90's down to the 50's and 60's. The trees have not yet begun to change color, but I am certain within a few days the first tinges will appear...ever so slightly at first, and the bursting forth with fiery array.
