I am so exhausted. We had to mandatorily "volunteer" our time today at the company open house. Mind you, this isn't wine and cheese for 100 people, this is an all-day event for over 10,000 people. So, it's over now and everything went well. Tonight, I am going home to do only exciting things like...well, like my laundry. It doesn't get much better than this!  ha ha ha.
