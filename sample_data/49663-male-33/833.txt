The Search for Peter Ermides    This is a photo of an old friend, Peter Ermides. We met when I was at OSU doing an internship at Players Theatre Columbus. He was playing  Zangara  in  Assassins  and I was teching/understudying. He went on to play the title role in  Tommy  on Broadway. I've lost track of him and wonder where he is. After his  urlLink IBDB  listing in 1997, he seems to have disappeared. The funny thing is, I remember that he loved sundried tomatoes...
