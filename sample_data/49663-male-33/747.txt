Toby's been a bit under the weather, so he went to the vet today. 42 bucks later, he's got this FABULOUS Elizabethan cone collar to keep him from chewing his lower extremities to smithereens. What's funny is the fact that he's a 7-pound dog with a HUGE plastic collar on...he looks akin to a satellite dish...and he's REALLY clumsy. I feel half bad for him, but the rest of the time, I'm laughing hysterically at him loping around with this enormous plastic hoo-ha. Quite entertaining! Prognosis: he'll be back to normal within 72 hours...at which point, the collar can come off. Until then, he's my low-tech in-home entertainment system.
