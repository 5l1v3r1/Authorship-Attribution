So, apparently the hotel where I'll be staying in NYC tomorrow thru Saturday is only rated as 2 diamonds...and my travel agent friend Phil says he would NEVER, I repeat, NEVER send a client to a low-rated property like that. Naturally, I was horrified. So, I looked into it. it doesn't look bad at all. In fact, it looks quite nice! It didn't stop me from putting in a priceline bid, however, somewhere else.
