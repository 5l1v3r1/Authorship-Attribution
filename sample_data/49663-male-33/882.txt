excerpt from  Where Birds Gather ...   Awake the past three fall mornings lying next to the gently breathing, warm, warm man pale with dreams and sweetened by the naivete morning brings. His arms around me - keeping me from moving - from leaving him. The very sweetness of his soul slips forward with every drowsy breath rendered. Sometimes, when he's deep in sleep, his lips form shapes and he utters garbled, unintelligible sentences...as if he were at once speaking to me in code, and muttering secrets meant not at all for my ears.   When morning blooms and we both stumble ungraciously into consciousness - when reality retaliates for all of the stolen moments, we are thrust into a coldness - bright light silvery and gray. There is no warmth here - no comfort, no embrace. Only quick morning ablutions and a swift retreat to schedules, oxfords and work. But, in those moments when it is still, when it is still darkness and quiet...asleep with him, afloat in the warmth...I memorize this.
