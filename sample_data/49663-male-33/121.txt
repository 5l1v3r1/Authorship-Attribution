This afternoon, Rachel and I walked over to the Atlanta Bread Company for lunch. We had our sandwiches by the park, enjoying a beautiful fall day. She took some photographs for her photographgy/design class...some of me..so we'll see how those turn out. If they're any good, I'll post them on the front page of my site.
