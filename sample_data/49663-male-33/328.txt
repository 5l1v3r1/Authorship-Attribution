Yesterday moved quickly. I spoke to my sweet guy in the morning, before he went to pick up his friend Eric at the airport. I went to the studio to work on a new song with Doug:  the subject of dreams  derived from the poem I wrote Dan last week. It differs slightly from the original. I had GAWM last night, which went terrifically well, and then I went out for a drink with my parents. We really enjoyed catching up last night...really nice to spend some quiet time with them. Tonight, Rachel and I are hosting a little  Oscar  party here at the house. I think we're all set. Well, I hope you're all having terrific weekends, too! Talk to you soon.
