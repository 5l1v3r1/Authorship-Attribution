my big gay life (5)       I think some young cops are cute, okay? I do. Not the older, pot-bellied, good-ole-boy version...but the slick, handsome, fit ones who make you want to drive recklessly in hopes of getting pulled over. This was my thought today as Kelly and I were driving back from a little retail frenzy this afternoon. Our little tour took us to Borders, Gap and to Nature's Bin. Sound hideously yup-urban? It is, I guess. There's no denying it. Between our closets full of Gap, Structure and J. Crew, our tables and shelves filled with books on every imaginable subject and a refrigerator full of healthy, organic foods...it's no wonder I don't have a boyfriend. I'm too preppy, well-read and healthy. The right guy will never find me if I keep up these shenanigans.      Note to self: Eat more Twinkies!
