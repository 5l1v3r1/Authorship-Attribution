Okay, full report on the date last night. I picked Matt up at 8pm. We drove to the Cedar-Lee Theatre to see "Saving Grace." Matt played two pieces he composed, one was a piece for solo Cello, and one was a Concertina for 40+ instruments. To say this guy is extremely talented is a gross understatement. I was really moved by his work. We had a mandarin martini before the movie (yummy!) and I could be carted away for contributing to underage drinking. As it turns out, he will be 21 in November. Lord help me rob this cradle!! LOL. Anyway, we had a delightful evening...and ONLY Trish gets all the details.
