All in all, a very nice weekend. I had my Christmas madrigal concerts on Friday and Saturday evenings (both went well) and Kelly and I had Steve as a house guest this weekend while he recovered (flawlessly I should say) from oral surgery. I worked for a few hours yesterday and caught a few minutes of the Radio City show and Act II of A Christmas Carol. Both look great!! Anyhow, sorry for the lack of writing, but it's been nice taking a few days off...just like last week. Anyhow, I'll get back on the stick soon enough...
