In the mailbag today, I received inspiration from Gregg Mackey, who suggested that I name the site  unextraordinary.com  Well, Gregg, you win the fabulous prizes...now just when I get the whole thing transferred will be another story. However, it should be seamless on your end. More mailbag fun: Andrew's very  adorable  and  sassy  significant other, Cinnamon, wrote me and made an introduction...as we've only heard about each other through Andrew. Poor thing's been reading my blog...it may have peeled 5 or so years off her life...so sorry...the minutes you spend here  you can never get back ! (Cue spooky music)  Muahahahahahahaahaha!!!  Nah, just kiddin! Welcome! And an  unextraordinary  welcome to all my new visitors this week! Aloha!
