Saturday passed quickly, having slept thru half of it. Rachel and Keith and I went to see  Eric Bogosian  live at the Ohio Theatre...we really enjoyed his concert...I would go back and see him  again ...highly recommended! Yesterday, I had tech. Sunday for my show. It was grueling, but some of the special effects are up and running and look very cool! Work today is keeping me  slammed  busy, but the day is passing!! I'm groovin' out to Sade's new CD.
