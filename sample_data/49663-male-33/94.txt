Right, so...today starts with a Board meeting for the theatre where I volunteer. We are in the midst of reading scripts to choose the 01-02 season. As I am driving home (Noonish) I receive a phone call from Kelly saying that someone was trying to break into our garage. Apparently this MORON decided to try the break-in in midday with over 5 neighbors watching him. Don't worry...he didn't manage to bust his way into the (very empty) garage. He did manage to get himself caught by the police. However, because he didn't ACTUALLY break-in, they can't arrest him. And even though there were so many eyewitnesses, they don't have enough evidence. Whatever. Kelly and I are now quite paranoid...something that will rub off in a few days, I'm sure.   On a happier note, I went back into the recording stuidio today to clean up a few tunes - and THAT went exceedingly well! Yay me. I'm not sure what my plans for this evening will be, but I'll let you know, eventually. Peace.
