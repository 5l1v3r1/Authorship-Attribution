my big gay life (35)       a big gay update       God, I have been so lax in the MBGL department. Its almost as if the warm weather just saps you of any creative energy. I haven't had the urge to do any major writing. However, just because it's been warm, doesn't mean I have nothing to catch you up on...     Trish came for a great visit this past weekend...Kelly went off to Colorado for a vacation (Todd is left to his own devices at home now muahahahahaha!) and rehearsals for  Chicago  are going at full-tilt. I spend most of the day just feeling exhausted, but we only have two more weeks of rehearsal. So, I'll either be in really great shape, or dead. Either way, I get a rest! Not too much going on in the romance arena, not that there's any time, mind you.  I am jonesing to get back into the studio...I've been absent for way too long. Doug had a great conversation with the publisher who wants to pick up our stuff...he currently only represents about 75 songs and gets over 400,000 inquiries a month...so that's very respectable exposure. I'll update you as I learn more. Well, this being my first and only early night...I'm going to sign off and say goodnight!
