I am online chatting with an old friend from my days as an intern at Players Theatre Columbus, Kelly Carolyn Gordon...who remains, one of the most fun people in memory. She's in Georgia finishing up her dissertation. She and I had to share a desk in the intern's office. We ended up creating a lot of mischeif and silliness....more on her later.
