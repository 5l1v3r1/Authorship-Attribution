urlLink  Wow...feeling way left-out of all the good times being had in NYC this week. I may need to call in the understudy and jet off to the Big City for the BlogMeet, or is it some sort of festival? A fair? Sex-a-thon? Looks like  urlLink RJ  and  urlLink Bill  and  urlLink Jonno  will all be there. I feel so outta the loop. So, I am now hereby declaring the first ever (that I know of) Midwest festival of the Blogs:  blog OHIO  ...open to all blogging folks in the greater Midwest area. I'll invite  urlLink Andrew  and  urlLink Cinnamon  and  urlLink Brandon  and that Katie-chica from  urlLink JeJune  (that's a good start). Where else can we drum-up some other regional bloggers? We may not have the dramatic NYC skyline as out backdrop, but we do have the Cheesecake Factory...ha ha...just kidding. We actually don't have one of those.
