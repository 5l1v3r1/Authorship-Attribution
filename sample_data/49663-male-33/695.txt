I only want to say...    Ha! I woke up today in near paralysis. So, I dragged my ass to the chiropractor (my first-ever visit) at the urging of my mother and my friend Phil. Amazing! It really does make a difference! You should have seen the X-Rays! My hips were all way outta whack. Anyhow, after a few adjustments, the sharp pain was obliterated, and I'm left with mild muscular fatigue in the lower back area. Hey, did this suddenly turn into my medical ailments blog? Nah...not really. I promise to get back to the writing soon. It's just tough to write thru chronic pain. But, that seems to be on its way out...   check ya later...
