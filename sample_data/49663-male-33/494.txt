When I got home tonight, I nursed Kelly back into tip-top shape...made her a little carrot/apple/grape juice and her hangover headache disappeared! We took Toby for a nice long walk down at Edgewater Park. We all enjoyed the scenery...men on rollerblades, men on bikes, men walking, working-out and playing football. How I love summer. Tonight, I'll work on cleaning my room and finishing up some laundry. Tomorrow's a half-day at the office, so I'll probably work in the studio in the afternoon. Friday evening is another matter altogether. Will there be a date? Won't there?
