Oh my god. It's NOT him. The Mystery David that was located and identified is the WRONG person ENTIRELY! This kind person returned my call this evening. And, while he DID know the mutual friend, he was not the David that attended ROCKY HORROR...in fact, he hadn't seen it at all. I apologized for the awkwardness and the inconvenience. He was exceedingly sweet and said he was disappointed that he wasn't the right guy. So, now  we're back at SQUARE ONE, o blog! What to do? Well, our mutual contact is back out of town for yet another week, so I suppose we'll have to wait. Unreal. This kinda stuff only happens to me...in case you were wondering.
