I wonder how you get a job as an accident investigator at the NTSB? I think my friend Megan and I would be great at this...we like to investigate plane crashes and lay blame. What could be better than working at the NTSB? We'd get to sift thru smoldering wreckage, poke around the rubble and ask the tough questions...not to mention point fingers and accuse airlines of negligence. I think it sounds fun.
