Greetings and a very special wet, slobbery kiss to the very sexy Steve Greer of NYC's League of American Theatres and Producers...who was thoughtful enough to send my a card wishing me well on last week's opening of  Chicago . Thanks, Steve (psst: we all know you're a regular reader, and I love you even more for it...) Steve is one of those good-time Charlies (not to be confused with everyone's FAVORITE  urlLink blogging good-time Charlie ) who can show a girl a good time in the city...but that's all I'll disclose here.
