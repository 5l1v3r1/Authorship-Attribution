I subscribed to this entertainment/gossip magazine so I could receive the free gift (which was all I really wanted): Absolute 80's. It's a double CD set with all those weird songs we liked growing up in the 80's. Remember "Sugar Walls" or "We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off (To Have a Good Time)" or what about "C'est La Vie?" THOSE were some TUNES!  Not a single ACTUAL instrument on any of 'em. Ahhh...the synthesizer at it's best. Moog. Those were the classic days of artificial sound.
