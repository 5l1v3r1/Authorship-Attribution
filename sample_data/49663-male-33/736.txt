I have the scores of three musicals rattling around my head at the moment...which makes for some pretty interesting mental soundtracking. My inner Broadway is feuding between  Footloose ,  The Sissy Show  and  Guys and Dolls ...and it's just not pretty. How can  Luck Be a Lady Tonight  when I'm  Holding Out for a Hero  til the morning light?!?
