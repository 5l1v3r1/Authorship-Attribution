There was a part 2 to last night's circus of embarrassment. I called a mutual acquaintance whose name is Tom (not Dr. Tom). I had seem Tom and his friend Bill speaking to Mystery David during intermission of ROCKY HORROR. When I called Tom, I explained the crazy events thus far and he agreed to call Bill and find out this guy's last name. He added that he thought it was awfully cute that I would go to such measures to find someone. When he called, he confirmed that David REALLY is David's correct first name, but that neither he nor Bill actually know what his LAST name is. Again: "Hello, Todd! Meet SQUARE ONE." So, now I have called back Mark to let him know he sent me to the WRONG David...and if he could please think back and remember the ACTUAL 3 people he went with to ROCKY HORROR. He is out of town for another week, so I gotta wait. So, what else is new?
