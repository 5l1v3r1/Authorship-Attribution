We here at unextraordinary.com are starting a brand new project which we have been calling, in all of our research and development meetings,    Romancing the Steve  . It's an investigation of the dating habits of a wide range of men across the spectrum of sexual orientation. We began wondering why all of our fabulous female friends were single...and then we started wondering why  we  we still single, and decided to do a little digging. Just why is there wide-spread singledom? Why are perfectly perfect guys going undated? Whose fault is it? Why should we succumb to the pressures of coupling? Why won't that total hottie just go ahead and ask me out already?    We are in the preliminary stages of our research and writing, but we're looking forward to publishing our first profile soon. If you're a dude and think you're "normal" and would like to be profiled in our series of articles, please contact us via  urlLink email . Who knows, we might get you a date...   We here at the unextraordinary.com research labs will bring you quality data, indices and results galore...complete with easy to understand charts and graphs, so stay tuned!!
