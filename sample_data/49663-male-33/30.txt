It's time to, once again, open up the  urlLink E M e R G e  Mailbag! The email of the week come from Isajd from Rekyavik, Iceland. Isajd writes:  Hello? Who are you? Why are you so strange? I think you look funny. What is that picture behind you? You live where in USA?   Well, Isajd, I am Todd. I am only mildly strange and only mildly strange-looking (thanks for noticing). The picture behind me at my desk is a poster for MISS SAIGON that was an advertisement used on the side of a commuter bus. Yes, I live where in the USA. Thanks for writing...and keep EMeRGing!!  :::kiss kiss::
