Last night, I ended up back in the studio mixing and mastering the final edit of  Sorry ...which totally smokes. It's sultry, sexy and resigned. I love it! I also had the chance to do a rehearsal take on  say the perfect thing  which is a difficult song to sing, technically. It's very demanding, and I need a lot more rehearsal before I attempt another take. Let's see, what else? Heard from another boy (whom shall remain nameless at this juncture) who wants to get together in a week or so when he's in town. The universe is weird when it comes to guys.
