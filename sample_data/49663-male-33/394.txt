I have just returned from the  Great All-American Suburban Shopping Mall Experience  at the South Park Center in Strongsville, Ohio. The place was mobbed with hundreds of look-alike teen girlies and boyz. It's amazing what a couple hundred bucks can buy you in the self-esteem department. After all, I know the new pair of jeans I purchased won't break-up with me (tongue firmly planted in cheek). Today is Good Friday, the 13th...and it really is. The sun is high and bright and life is good...
