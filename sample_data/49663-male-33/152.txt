Today, in my hallucinogenic funk, I have been working on the advertising and promotional plans for the National Tour of FAME: The Musical. This has been quite a lot of fun, because the show lends itself to all sorts of odd promotion. Do you remember the TV series from '82-'83? You remember Debbie Allen and Leroy...ooh! and Doris and Bruno...with all that hair. Fame...I wanna live forever...
