Choosing photographs for a new book is not as easy as you would think. We're publishing a book about the history of our 5 theaters...productions, stars, etc...and it apparently takes 7-8 people to decide which pics we're using. Mind you, this task was almost useless as many of us have not even read the copy. I had a dreadful board meeting tonight out in Chagrin. Tonight is the meeting where we get to present the board re-unification document to both sides. I am confident, however, that Tim's and my work on it has been balanced enough to circumvent any real explosions or roadblocks. Wish me luck. You know how I love meetings (especially long ones).
