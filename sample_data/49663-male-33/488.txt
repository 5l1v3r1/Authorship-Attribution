Some days, I just can't bring myself to write a single interesting thing, which, if you're a regular reader...you already know. I mean, I could sit here and tell you all about my publicity photo shoot for Chicago...or I could tell you about my really cool costume (I won't)...or I could just wait for inspiration to hit me. So, I am gonna sit here for awhile until something GRABS me. Thank you for your patience with me, really. I don't deserve you.
