I came home today to a very sick Kelly. She spent the day vomiting and sleeping, alternately. We did manage to get some food into her, which seemed to make a difference. Hopefully, when she wakes up tomorrow (her birthday) she'll be feeling 100% better! As for me, I am wandering around my rather empty house thinking about Matt...wondering if he's had a safe trip to Chicago. I imagine that I'll be heading to bed soon. Maybe I'll do some reading and a little more writing. I need to write another song soon or Doug's going to come after me. Maybe this one will be a happy/hopeful love song.
