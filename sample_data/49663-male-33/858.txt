OK! Now, for all of you procrastinators...   Much to the chagrin of many crotchety, old theater critics,  urlLink THOSE SEVEN LITTLE WORDS (I Love You, So You're Probably Gay)  has extended its run thru September 27th! Like cockroaches and Cher, we're still here! It takes a little more than an angry tranny to close our show! So, hurry up and get yourselves to the show, damnit!!
