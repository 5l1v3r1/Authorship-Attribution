I am always heartened and amazed at the emotional generosity of people. Sometimes it takes a nasty little event (like a break-up) to make you realize the abundance you have in your life. I could never have imagined the random, un-prompted outpouring of love I have received today...a day when I really need it. It's astonishing what the Universe provides when we ask for it. I am grateful, and humbled.
