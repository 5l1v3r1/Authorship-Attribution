If you were close enough to kiss, I'd lay a big one on you. Are you okay? You seem upset and/or worried. Of course I still want to see you. If you're worried about what I'm thinking...don't. To be honest, I already had a pretty clear sense about his visit. Call it part intuition and part interpretive skills...in any case, who you choose to see & meet is, of course, totally your prerogative...and I respect that. I hope you know that I am absolutely crazy about you & feel so great that you want to, and choose to spend time with me. Again, I feel so lucky to have you in my life at all. How many times can I say that in one week? LOL. Sending you tons of warm hugs. Shake it off, my cute man.
