So, I just want to report that I went to the theatre last night to see  urlLink  Tony n' Tina's Wedding  . It was exactly what the doctor ordered: 3 hours of complete and hysterical diversion. I was lucky enough to get a comp to the show which costs $58 otherwise. So, I recommend everyone getting out this week...away from the television...go see some live theatre...go on...get  outta  here!
