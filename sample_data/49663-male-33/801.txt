river   The photograph  imperfect though our smiles were as we boarded that raft and set sail into the Nantahala with rapids to be forded and miles to discover from backwards to future tense, dreams and disappointments swallowed in eddies lapping at our prickled flesh  we overturned in the smooth quiet waters above silky unseen boulders, feet touching, slipping from moss and slime redirecting our course toward some swirling angry pool begging us forward we clutch and claw the rubber hauling ourselves over and inward heaving our water weight aboard back just above the thin slice of boat, resting and breathing laughing at our own soggy misfortune, waiting for another turn dizzy and silly  some of those hours floated by green and gray beguiled, we watched the shore slip past in an endless ribbon silky and raw and it was unreachable and unstoppable as we gurgled past our own present an odd circus we watched from the river, an audience rushing downstream in the weight of the water sifting us and sorting us through rocks and channels; bobbing up and licking the sky; sinking with us toward rounded pebbles and gravel bottom  there is no end, only departure from Nantahala and we wave goodbye with paddle and knapsack, with scraped knees and chipped teeth wading in the calm toward the flat, toward the dusty and the dry watching as we pass, knowing we will never again return
