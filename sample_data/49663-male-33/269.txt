Not to be too "teen girly" on you, but did you happen to catch Larry King Live (or re-run later) on CNN yesterday? The men of *NSYNC looked dreamy...:::swoooon:::not that they managed to answer any questions very thoughtfully, or with much style and/or panache, but they were delightfully charming. Joey still insists he has this "girlfriend" who splits time between Orlando and LA. Hmmmm...yeah, I have a girlfriend, too... "girlfriend...things that make you go hmmm..."  Chris sounded like the hysterical little freakshow that he is, and JC looked like a porcupine with a soul patch. I will say that Lance looked the best of all of 'em.
