Ahh...glorious Sunday! A day for laundry, housecleaning and other various mundane activities. However, I am determined not to let these tasks get the better of me. The weather is astonishingly beautiful, and a long drive out to the country is in order - that is, AFTER I finish my laundry. Matthew is coming home tonight from Chicago, so I'm very excited to see him again. I do miss him when he's away. I hope this week goes smoothly, and that I can clear all my work tasks out of the Friday window - as Matt and I would like to leave as early as possible for Philadelphia.
