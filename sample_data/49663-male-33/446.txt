my big gay life (14)   I have decided, after much thought, that going to the party this Saturday is probably not in my best interest. You know damn well he's going to go...if for no other reason than to see if I'm there. Although I am sure I'd manage to have a great time, maybe I really don't need the aggravation of dealing with Dan & related issues and feelings. So, better that I stay at my closing night party and avoid any possible "random" run-ins. I guess I'll know when I'm really ready to deal with being around him again, it has been a whole month, after all.  sigh...
