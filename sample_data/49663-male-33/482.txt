Lots of fun stuff going on at work today...lots of little details and loose-ends are finally getting wrapped-up. I love when that happens! Rachel and I took a nice walk over to the Galleria for lunch. We sat outside in the blazing white sun amongst all the beautiful people who seem to work over in that quadrant of the city. After a quick stroll through the mall, we meandered our way back to the office and the cool, dry air conditioning.
