Matt and I drove to Philly this past weekend. We left at Noon on Friday and drove straight through to Trish's house. We made great time, arriving just after 7:30pm. Friday night, we went to Dave and Buster's for a late dinner and then returned home to drink wine and to let Matt do a couple of loads of laundry. Saturday, we had breakfast at the Court Diner, lunch with Jen Lomas, Amy and Nick. Then, Trish, Matt and I headed into the city to walk around. Matt had plans to have dinner with his family that night, so Trish and I headed home for dinner at her house. We picked Matt up in the city at 9:45pm and went downtown for a drink at a bar called "Woody's." Sunday, we loafed around until Matt and I had to leave. When we got back to Cleveland, there was almost 2 inches of snow on the ground! Ugh! Welcome home!!
