Exciting Discoveries at Work    Wherein Todd finds love and cake.    Okay, maybe not love, but today is   Cake Day   here at our venerable old institution. Once monthly, we congregate in an old abandoned cabaret venue to celebrate birthdays and consume vast quantities of baked confections, salty treats and sugary soda-pop. I like the marble-swirled cake...mixing up the chocolate and white cake, like soft-serve swirl ice cream cones. But, my favorite of your basic cakes is yellowcake with chocolate frosting. I'm presently writing you from deep inside a sugar coma. I'll be back later, following my withdrawal and sugarshock. Ciao!
