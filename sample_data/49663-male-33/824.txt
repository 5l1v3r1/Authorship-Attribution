Take me home.   Did you ever have about half the weekend you'd expected? I don't mean cut short...more like cut short on expectation and return. I had one of those weekends. I have to remind myself to not collapse myself into desired outcomes...you set yourself up for disappointment almost every time. But, shouldn't we have high expectations for ourselves and others?   I've been doing some minor organizing this weekend...straightening up and such, and I've come across a fairly hideous collection of music from my high school and college days. Some of this may be forgiven in light of the fact that I was a budding homosexual at seventeen. I had not really developed a sense of style or taste. Some would argue that I still haven't (You know who you are...and you can shut up this very instant!). Besides my breathtaking early collection of musical theatre recordings, I found Technotronic, SNAP! and MARRS. Ugh. What was I thinking? Do you suppose I could get anything for them on Ebay?!?
