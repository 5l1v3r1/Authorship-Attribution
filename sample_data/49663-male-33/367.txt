my big gay life (2)    I have decided that my next boyfriend should know absolutely nothing about the internet, computers or chat rooms. I think, in some ways, the internet allows for artificial intimacy. Words are powerful. People say things they might not say in person. The internet enables a superficial closeness, so by the time you get to actual physical intimacy, no one knows what they're doing. Except me, of course, because I am smart, funny and handsome. So, will my next boyfriend be Amish? Hard to say. I'm not big into no electricity, churning butter or waking at the butt-crack of dawn. Where is that technologically-hopeless man of mine? I know he must be out there.
