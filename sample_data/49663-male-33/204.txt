Whew! Christmas is over! All in all, it was quite terrific! I had a great time visiting with my family. Today is pretty quiet here at work. I'll probably only stay a few hours, and then head home to clean the house, do laundry...etc. All of this needs to get done before Kelly comes home from visiting her mother in Connecticut. I may stop at Dave's for Boxing Day.
