Crazy! It's been awhile since I've been able to update, but I finally managed to write that book review. So far, no word from my editor...which I guess is good..unless she's too busy marking it up with a red pen to email me. We'll see. Anyway, it feels great to have that out of the way.  Whew!  It gets published in January, so I'll be sure to post a copy of my glorious contribution to Ohioana Journal. In other news, we're busy electing a new Mayor and City Council...so Kelly and I have rounds and rounds of political parties to attend this evening... (insert haughty snort here)
