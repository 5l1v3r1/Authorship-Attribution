Just to clarify...since it ended 3 months ago...I am   so   over Dan. Just continuing because there are several of you who have asked me to just bite the bullet and finish posting them. Don't forget! The big, exciting conclusion to the series happened April 9th, so stay-tuned! It won't be long now! In the immortal words of  Queenie  in   Show Boat    "Misry's Comin' Around." As for the rest of you, just skip over it. I'll continue with  my big gay life  for y'all.
