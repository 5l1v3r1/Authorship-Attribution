I have grown used to saying goodbye to people...and I mean that in the least melodramatic way possible. I'm used to it, I just am. Sometimes we want everything to remain the same, and sometimes we want everything to change...and some of us are stuck somewhere in between.     Either way you look at it, I suppose it's good to stir it up a bit. I guess change is change, but it's not always a solution, or more accurately, the total solution. Many times, it's stop-gap until we get to the root of what's really eating us. Change tends to peel back a few layers, like a sticky bandage on a wound...revealing sometimes the painful, sometimes the scarred...and sometimes the healed.    So, we are travelers, journeyers. Go find what  you  seek, that mysteries may be revealed.
