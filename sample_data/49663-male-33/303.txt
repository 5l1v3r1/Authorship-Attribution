I've decided that the next phase of my career will involve moving to Puerto Rico. Strategically, I think this will enhance my life...I will hang out on the beaches for sunrise and sunset...I will cease worrying about the cost of heating my house. I will suddenly become more attractive to friends and family members. And heck, it's easy to get there...what with it being a US Territory and all. Just think how  wonderful  it would be! I have visited the island 5 or 6 times and  loved  it. Must start brainstorming....
