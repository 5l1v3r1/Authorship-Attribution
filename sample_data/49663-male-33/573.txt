So, I arrive at work this morning  early . This is merely to do with the fact that I was house/dog sitting waaaay out in Russell Township and had no idea just how long morning rush would take. As luck would have it, I even beat my boss to the office. However, on my jaunt over to Starbucks, I noted a gray smoke billowing from the Keith Building just down the block...the building which houses our Palace Theatre. That can't be good, I thought to myself as I ordered my Venti Traditional with room for cream. As it turns out, some electrical transformer caught fire in the basement, the building was evacked...but no one was injured, thankfully. The only property seriously damaged by the fire was a restaurant on the main floor called Acapella...which sustained major smoke damage. I hope Karen, the owner, gets a huge settlement check and that she reopens...I love that restaurant. Anyhow, the Keith Bldg. is also one of Cleveland's telecommunications/tech. hubs...so, our internet and telephone systems were down for the morning. This is not conducive to efficient business. At any rate, I am home now doing a load of laundry before I head out to the theatre this evening. Don't forget I'm out in the country. Send me emails!!!
