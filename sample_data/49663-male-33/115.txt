Yesterday was like a dream - like everything that happened was out of some sort of perfect script...the way your boyfriend is supposed to meet your parents. It was incredible! It was so comfortable and sweet and enjoyable - eveyone had a wonderful experience...unless they're flat-out lying to me (I don't think so). So, the always-nerve-wracking "meet the parents" thing is overwith...and it was great! We'll all do it again sometime! Mom was a dream: sweet, welcoming, warm and funny. Dad was engaging, fun and put Matt at ease right away.
