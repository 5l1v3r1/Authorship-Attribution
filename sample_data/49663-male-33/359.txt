So, an update. Turns out, that scary pain in my groin was some sort of pulled muscle in the pelvic region. It's almost completely gone now. Thanks to everyone who shared their concerns with me. So, for now I am relatively pain-free. Today was a crazy one here at work...we had a special even from 4-6pm which I had to MC. I'm headed home now, and then over to the studio to do some work. More later...
