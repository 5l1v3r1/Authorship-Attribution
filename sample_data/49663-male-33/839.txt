wandering near the end of the road...    I woke up today to news of my grandmother's hospitalization overnight. She's going on 96 and remains my favorite person on the planet. She's doing much better, but today was tough on both of us. She's in a hospital just down the street from me, so I was able to spend the entire day and evening with her. I witnessed an amazing change in her over the course of my visit. I walked into her room just before noon, and was confronted with a terrified and pale woman not sure she would live to see sunset. She was frightened and alone...and my heart broke into a million pieces. The only part I could fix was to ease her fear and to just be there...so at least she wasn't alone while waiting to find out what was wrong with her. It turns out that she had a bit of pneumonia which caused an irregularity in her heartbeat. It caused her heart to race, while at the same time decreasing her oxygen levels. So, once the docs explained that her heart wasn't damaged or failing, you could almost see her reinflate. They are treating the pneumonia and observing her for a couple of days. I had a really amazing day with her and was so thankful I could be there when she really needed me. I left the hospital and immediately fell to pieces on my drive home. I was at once exhausted, joyful and terrified. As a rational human being, I know she's 95 and can't live forever. As her grandson, I can't bear to see her in pain or terrified or sad. But I do know that I can only be present...in the moment with her. I can take away the lonliness. I can ease her fear. I can love her, as I always do, completely, every day. In return, she does the same for me...as she has for over thirty years.   And we find our way through this place...together.
