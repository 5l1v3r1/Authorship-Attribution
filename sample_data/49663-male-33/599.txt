I have started to write something three or four times now, and I don't seem to get very far. I have nothing profound to say. I don't feel appropriate being my typical glib self, so I remain silent. I will say that I am grateful for every single report of survivors being pulled out of the wreckage, and for the record number of people donating blood, goods and services. For that, I am thankful...and hopeful.
