I had a great night at rehearsal for BILOXI BLUES last night. We ran the first act over and over...these guys are really talented...and a scream! I'm really enjoying myself - being in a completely new and different sphere of people. The guys in the show are fun, funny, interesting and always entertaining. Life does spin on a dime, this opportunity to work with my favorite director was certainly a well-timed blessing. Theatre is always therapy for me...and in just a few days it seems my world has completely turned around. I think that's totally cool!
