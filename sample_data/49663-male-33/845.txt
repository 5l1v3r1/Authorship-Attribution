a bit of publicity for Ohno Zone & unextraordinary!    As promised, here is the link to The Plain Dealer's Sunday Magazine article. Many thanks to Noelle, Yuki, Will, Apolo, Judie and everyone else who helped push this project along since February. I figure that a but of publicity in June can't be bad for the sport, right?!?     From the print edition :  " When Apolo-mania first hit during the 2002 Olympics, 100 fan sites popped up. Very few remain. Todd's site has stood the test of time ." - Yuki Ohno    To clarify, Kathleen (the writer) said we receive 1,300 hits a day. That's incorrect. We receive over 1,300 unique visitors daily. Our hits are much higher, registering over 21,000 hits daily(average over 17 months). Oh, and sorry 'bout your last name, Noelle!    In any case, enjoy!     urlLink Click here!
