Just got back from a meeting to discuss a brand-new musical we're producing with Dodger Theatricals. It's called  The Magician  right now, but it's going to workshop here in Cleveland this summer, and then move to Broadway. What a cool concept! Using the illusions of Harry Blackstone, Ivan Menchell has weaved a wonderful romantic comedy. Apparently, the show will rehearse and open in our Ohio Theatre for a four week run. Then, it will transfer to the Great White Way in October.
