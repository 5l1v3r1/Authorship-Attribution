travel sick.    So, I am getting ready to leave for L.A. on Wednesday. All I can say is that I'm leaving feeling like there are more than one or two strands undone...things incomplete. I hate that. I have projects at work to shepherd through...things to organize at home and this overall sinking feeling. Typical. I chalk it up to travel anxiety...not fear of travel, but a consciousness of the stresses involved when moving your life back and forth over a period of days and locations. All I can do is brush it off. Once I'm actually in Cali, I'll feel like I can manage all that's left to be managed in Cleveland. But, when I travel for work, it seems things get effed-up more easily. Ads get misplaced, or worse, don't run at all. Articles get bumped from the Sunday Arts section to oblivion and someone somewhere along the way has a complete and utter meltdown because I'm not where I usually am. This, combined with the fact that I will have over 300 emails to deal with, makes me nauseous about work travel. I know,  doom, doom, doom!  But, truthfully, that's what happens, consistently. So, am I excited to go to L.A.? No. But I am excited to see my friends and spend some quality time, even knowing what'll be waiting for me upon my return. I am not feeling terribly grounded at the moment, so we're talking emotional   magnification  , baby!   I'll be alright. Check me in like, a week.
