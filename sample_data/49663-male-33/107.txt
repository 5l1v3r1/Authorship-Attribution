Dear Blog, Today I cut my sister's hair off. It started out innocently enough...just a trim here and a trim there. In my effort to keep everything even, I kept clipping...until she looked like Demi Moore in the Navy SEALs movie. Well, seriously pissed-off is not quite accurate when it comes to describing my sister's reaction. I, on the other hand, think she looks quite fetching with her new do. After all, there ARE benefits...it dries really fast in the morning, she won't need to apply ungodly amounts of hair styling products and she looks really TOUGH. In a phrase: wash-n-go. I told her it would only take 12 weeks to grow out. That's when the kitchen knives got pulled. I'll be staying at my friend's house for the next, I don't know, 12 weeks?
