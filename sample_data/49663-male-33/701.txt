Hey! Well, it was fantastic! We sold out the whole weekend, and are on course to be completely sold out for the entire run! The audiences loved it and gave us multiple standing ovations...which none of us expected. We were overwhelmed by their warmth and generosity. Yesterday's matinee was cancelled due to a major power outage...one that left my house without electricity all day Saturday. I enjoyed the day off after a long week of seven performances. Tonight, I'll be able to go home and stay there for once...
