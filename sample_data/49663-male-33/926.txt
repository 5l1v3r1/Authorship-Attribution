Sorry for the silence.  I was out of town for a conference that started last Wednesday. On this past Monday, the house right behind mine burned down. I woke up early Monday morning to my neighbors house in flames. I was at once fascinated and horrified. Everyone got out okay, but they lost two of their three pet dogs...along with most all of their belongings. It was heartwrenching...and even more so for them. Ugh!  I just got back from shooting a commercial outside in the rain today. I think the end result will be pretty goofy...but it was fun doing it! It had me and a handful of other Cleveland residents and business people lip-synching to this silly soundtrack about taxes. In the end, I probably will have humiliated myself in front of the entire viewing area, but what the hey?!?!
