So, here it is, the Saturday before Christmas...everyone seems completely freaked out of their minds...running last-minute errands, baking, wrapping, buying, etc. I managed to play "Chef Todd" today, making authentic Colonial Williamsburg Peanut Soup (George Washington's favorite) and some Hot Artichoke Dip for tomorrow's extended family gathering. However, I will need more than Artichoke dip to get me through the evening...hard liquor should do the trick. In any case, I wish all of you, my dear readers, the Happiest of Holidays to you and yours...
