Dear Sis,  I am currently writing to you from the all-too-chic Hudson Hotel on the edge of the Upper West Side and Hell's Kitchen. I don't have enough black in my wardrobe...that's what I've managed to figure out while here.    I met with Philip tonight and handed him the new CD. He seems quite excited AND excitable...which is how people should feel about our show. I think he has quite a good surprise awaiting him upon his first listen...    Again, you've done remarkable work with the new recording. I forgot to remind you to put the new Cowboy TV vocal on...the stale old boring one is still on this version. Are we gonna change it? Do I need another new take?    Ah well...   Hope all is well with you. Much love to you and Lucy!    Cheers,  Todd
