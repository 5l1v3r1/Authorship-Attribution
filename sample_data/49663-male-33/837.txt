Blogstalker     This time, I actually get to meet my dear, sweet friend Charlie. Weve known each other for a little more than two years. Hes been a bright spot in my life since I met him though weblogging. See, weve actually never met face to face. Sure, weve talked on the phone, emailed, and instant messaged, but weve never been in the same room. Two years ago, I deferred meeting him, as we had only been reading each others weblogs and, well, he does have the name stalker in the title of his blog. I had visions of being locked in a shady one room apartment while being forced to read old stagebill bios. As it happens, Charlie turned out to be one of the sweetest, most lovely people in all of Manhattan. He then promptly moved to New Orleans. Now, hes back in NYC and I cant wait to actually see him. Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting my weblogging friend, Jeff (late of Verdezza fame) and this year, Charlie will be my personal birthday gift.
