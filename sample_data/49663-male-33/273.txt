Also from the EMeRGe Mailbag...this remains one of my favorite emails ever:  Hi !  So here I am, a 24 year old, grown a** woman simply ecstatic over the fact  that I just scored a lovely seat for the *nsync concert in vegas. Thus, my  internet hopping begins. I must have a meet and greet pass! "lord, i know i  said if i got a ticket i would go to church every sunday from here on out,  but a meet and greet pass would get me up for sunday school too!" i type in  "meet and greet" and i am not surprised at the extreme number of people  begging online. Have some decency people please! but then i come across a  snippet of how a fan got cruised by joey. i was clicking faster than a 13  year old boy in Cindy Margolis.com. that brought me to our site and i must  admit i was laughing out loud at some points. you are realy funny and make  every day crap seem interesting, ya just got a new reader!   urlLink Erika   erikacane@yahoo.com  p.s.- where do you work! it sounds like you have the phattest job in the  world!
