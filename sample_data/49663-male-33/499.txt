There is always time for random babbling. Maybe there's not been enough of that lately, and for that, I apologize. I've been worrying about my recent dryspell in the lyrics/composition department...I've learned, however, not to force these things...they tend to emerge when they're good and ready. Not sure what tonight's plans are, but I'd like to go buy a juicer, or go see a movie. I'll be spending time in the studio doing Post work tomorrow evening, and who knows what on Thursday. In any case, I'm feeling neither prolific nor profound. Please excuse my verbal clattering for today.
