I haven't yet learned to read his vocal non-verbals or his physical non-verbals. Actions speak louder than words, so in that sense, he's golden. I think this kid has no fear. Less fear, anyway, than me or most adults I know. I know...he's an adult. He just seems so young to me...and he is. Damaged goods, definitely...there seems to be a lot of pain, heartbreak and mistrust. But we all remember those phases of our lives...I do. Nothing will make everything all better. I just wish him peace and joy. I really seem to like him - try as I may no to, but I can't help it.
