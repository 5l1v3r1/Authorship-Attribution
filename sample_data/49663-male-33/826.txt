My horoscope...dead on!     This is a good day to do some grounding activities, Todd. You could feel drawn to spend time outdoors. It would be good for you to connect with Mother Nature right now. You'll feel relaxed if you can go for a long hike or a stroll around the neighborhood. Don't keep yourself locked inside when the Earth is calling to you! If you like to garden, today could be the perfect time to do some planting, mowing, or weeding. You might feel a conflict between your public persona and the private you. If you are usually very outgoing, you might feel tired of acting this way. Don't allow yourself to be pressured into performing all of the time. If you're usually the center of attention, it might be best to stand off to the side. With Mercury sextile Uranus, you need some time to be introspective. Try to gather your thoughts.
