my big gay life (32)    I have to admit it to you all: I am working my way through a small wave of Dan-related depression. I just feel like I need a good cry. Sometimes I never understand why it happens, but today's seems to be rejection-related.  Maybe waking-up not feeling good was a factor...but for whatever the reason I feel down about it. I think my plans for the evening will help refocus my energy. My crew from work are all going to a new show opening at the Center for Contemporary Art, and then to Touch Supper Club for drinks and dancing afterward. The temperature and humidity here has been beastly. I just got my hair cut, and I'm waiting for my shirt to dry before I head out. I just wanted to say hi...talk to you all later. xoxo
