notes from a windy day...  Up early this morning. More gusting and noise kept me from the sleep. That, and a certain 25 pound Maine Coon who kept pacing and purring. Impossible to sleep. Rose at 4:50am to a dark and blustery morning. Cold too. Freezing. Took a walk down at the lakeshore. Watched waves at 10 feet crash over the breakwall and sand whip up from the dormant beach and fly toward downtown. Returned home to pot of fresh hot coffee, slumbering pooch and the start of the day, just dawning pinkish gray.
