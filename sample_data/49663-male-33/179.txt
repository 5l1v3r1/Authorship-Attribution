It's funny how a little snow and a nip in the air can make you feel completely different. As if we went from late fall into "The Holidays" in a single moment. All of a sudden: there it is. The snow is falling here...a little more lazily than yesterday, and people are already scurrying to get home. Today is one of those really odd days, in the sense that everything feels a little off-kilter. Not bad, necessarily, but different...kind of like those Saturdays that feel like Sundays.
