It feels strange not to have you here with me, but I guess it's a good thing  to miss somebody. God, I wish I could tell you how much I like you...but  words just aren't enough. I had a great time tonight with Kelly, but I really  missed being with you. Not a moment passed tonight when I didn't think of you.  You make me want to write poetry.
