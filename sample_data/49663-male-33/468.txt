Things all come around. Full circle, I mean. I've been thinking a lot about my friend, Michelle. She and I met when we worked for Sea World in high school. We went to Ohio State together, competed on the speech & debate team together and lived together for two years. We're not as close now as we have been, but we're still close, none the less. Anyway, she called today and invited me to her place for a fun little get-together with some of her family and friends. I am going to go for several reasons...one being that I want to catch-up, but I also want to do something with different people...which this will be. So, interesting opportunities do present themselves...usually in the darkest moment when it feels like you might actually be bored and depressed to death...a shift in direction occures. Oh, plus...some firm in another city/state is after me. It's great to be chased!
