I had my first BILOXI BLUES rehearsal last night. It looks like it's a fairly talented cast...a great group of guys! I love the play, it's one of Neil Simon's funniest, and still poignant. I seem destined to play accessible gay characters...which is A-OK with me! Hennesey is the last person you'd suspect to be gay...but then gets busted and tossed out of the Army...never to be heard from again. Cool, huh?
