Back from the rained-out bonfire. I did get a chance to walk around their property - approximately 8 acres way out in the wilderness. It was beautiful! Because it rained so much, we just sat inside and talked - and had really great food and conversation. That's all for tonight. Talk to you all later. OH! Welcome to new readers from Malaysia!
