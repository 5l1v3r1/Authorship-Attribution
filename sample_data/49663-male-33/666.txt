"Welcome the fuck back, Todd!"       This quote from a reader summarizes my glee at, once again, being able to post to my site via Blogger. It's been almost two weeks since any substantial posting and I was starting to get crabby.    While I'm on the soapbox, I'd just like to remind everyone that we all write weblogs for very different reasons. Weblogs are an expression of each individual...so, if you think they're all supposed to be a certain way...you can park it elsewhere, Mary...   My friend  urlLink Rachel   just started her weblog recently...so please check her out...she's sexy, sassy and smart...plus there's fat kittens on her site.
