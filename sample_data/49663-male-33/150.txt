I took a little nap after work today. I think it did me some good. I was awakened by the sound of the telephone chirping...or whatever you call that irritating electronic ringing. Anyway, it was Matt checking in. He offered to get a ride to my house tonight (very sweet) but since I am feeling under the weather, I told him to just stay home tonight. It's weird, tonight is the first time in a week we haven't slept together. Kelly and I are watching "The Way We Were" and she'll probably start crying soon.
