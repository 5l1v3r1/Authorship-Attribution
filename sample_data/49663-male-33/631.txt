This weekend seemed like a blur. Palooza was a giant success this past Sunday. We had over 8,000 people come down and participate in our free community open house. On Sunday evening I had my first rehearsal for the annual church Christmas Madrigal...this is my fourth year singing in the show, and I love it! Rehearsals are easy...only twice a week for two hours, so it barely seems like work. Sunday night we celebrated Kelly's birthday by watching our regular line-up" Queer As Folk and Leap Years...and by indulging in a little chocolate mousse. I am going to go on the "Harvest Moon Hike" down in the Park tonight...so I'm really looking forward to that. At the moment, all is well...and I can't be more thankful.
