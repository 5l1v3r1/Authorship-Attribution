I love the Appalachian Trail (most of my friends already know this). I have been on the trail twice, and have read almost every journal published on the subject. The trail extends 2,100 miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Katahdin ("greatest mountain") in Maine. I have a map of the entire trail on the wall next to my desk. It reminds me of the people who, every year, attempt to walk the entire distance. They inspire me. Kinda minimizes any challenges I face. Every so often I just say to myself, "2,100 miles."
