Okay, so maybe this year's concert wouldn't have caused me to launch my blog, but it was a great show! It was my first visit to the practically brand-spankin-new Cleveland Browns Stadium. It really is spectacular! We had club level seats, so we were in the first deck looking down onto the field & stage. The club level seats fewer people and has amazing amenities...like a gorgeous bar overlooking Lake Erie, plenty of restroom facilities and lots of friendly staff to assist you at every turn. The show itself was much better than last year's  No Strings Attached . Somebody who has a theatrical clue must have been in charge. Some of the new material sounds terrific...quite a surprising departure for them. In any case, we had a great night!! No, there was no gratuitous cruising last night, but if I had been at the meet and greet...well, that might have been another story...
