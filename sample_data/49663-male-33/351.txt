There is so much catching-up to do. I barely have time to fit it all in. This is final tech/dress rehearsal week for  Getting Away With Murder . So far, things have really come together beautifully. A far cry from my initial misgivings. So, that is happy news. I will be making a trip to Omaha, Nebraska this weekend. I've never been to Nebraska. I'll fill you in about that later.
