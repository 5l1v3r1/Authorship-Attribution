pop news   (from PEOPLE)  Backstreet's A.J. Expands Rehab Time   Backstreet Boys have put the brakes on their current North  America tour for a second time as group member A.J. McLean,  23, extends his time in rehabilitation for another two  weeks, the band announced Tuesday. McLean is in a 30-day  treatment program at an undisclosed rehab facility that  handles alcoholism, depression and other problems, his  bandmates first announced on MTV on July 9. The Boys had  been set to reconvene on the road next Tuesday but will now  resume on Aug. 24 in Milwaukee, according to a new  announcement from the band. "A.J.'s initial treatment is  going very well," Backstreeter Kevin Richardson said in a  statement. "His doctors have suggested it would be in A.J.'s  best interest to take an additional two weeks in transitional  care." The Backstreet Boys's tour is part of the promotion  for their new album, "Black & Blue," which has sold 5.2  million copies in the U.S. in the 35 weeks since its  release. That sales figure is far short of their previous  CD, "Millennium," which had sold 9.6 million copies in the  same amount of time, reports Reuters.
