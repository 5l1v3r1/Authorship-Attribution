sorry  \ I'm sorry I couldn't fix your troubles, I couldn't stop the pain, I'm sorry I wasn't the one, but I tried...I tried \ you said you loved me, but you never found your way, I couldn't be your everything, but I tried...I tried \ I wanted it all for you, I wanted it all from you, but you could never give, no you could never give \ I'm sorry I couldn't be the one, I'm sorry I couldn't make every wish come true, I'm sorry I couldn't do that for you, baby, but I tried...I tried \ I'm sorry you had to let go, I'm sorry you couldn't hold on, but love doesn't disappear, it doesn't disappear, no not like you, not like you \ I'm sorry for all your pain, for all you let between us, can't be your angel, baby, can't be your angel anymore, but I tried.
