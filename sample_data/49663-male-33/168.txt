I am approaching the gleeful END of my marathon laundry day. I have completed over 8 separate loads. Next round: ironing and folding. At least it keeps me busy while waiting to hear from my family (who are apparently MIA) and for Matt to get back to Cleveland. I am looking forward to seeing SEX IN THE CITY...I managed to miss it last week when I was picking Matt up at the airport and driving back down to Aurora. God, was that ONLY a week ago?
