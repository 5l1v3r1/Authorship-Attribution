Two of my close friends are currently on vacation in Europe. Jennie, who lives there anyway, is in Spain (as mentioned in an earlier blog entry) with ger German boyfriend, Markus. My friend Margaret is in Italy for 6 weeks hiking, biking and just generally fading into the landscape. She wants to visit small towns, major attractions and everything she can cram into 6 weeks. I have no idea where she is or what she's doing at this moment, however, I did beg her to visit Capri.
