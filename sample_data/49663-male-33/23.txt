Today was one of those absolutely gorgeous fall days. The temperature was just about 70 degrees, and the sun was bright and the sky, blue.  I went to Gap to buy Kelly a birthday gift and EVERY clerk in the store asked if I needed any help. I know I must have looked helpless in the women's section, but I do know what Kelly likes. Fortunately, I got the sizes right and she loved the outfit I picked. I cut the lawn for possibly the last time this season...I don't expect it'll grow much more. We went to Kelly's birthday dinner at a really wonderful Ethiopian restaurant called Empress Taytu. Matt called today from CHicago - twice. I guess he misses me as much as I miss him. I'm looking forward to seeing him tomorrow night when he gets home.
