Almost made you love me. Almost made you cry. Almost made you happy, baby, Didn't I? Didn't I? You almost had me thinkin' you were turned around, but everybody knows Almost doesn't count. Almost heard you sayin' you were finally free. What was always missing for you, baby...you'd found it in me. But you can't get to Heaven half off the ground. Everybody knows Almost doesn't count. I can't keep on lovin' you one foot outside the door. I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure. Can't keep on trying if you're looking for more than all that I could give you, than what you came here for. Gonna find somebody not afraid to let go. Want a no doubt be there kind of man. You came real close. But every time you built me up, you only let me down. And, everybody knows...Almost doesn't count. Maybe you'll be sorry. Maybe you'll be cold. Maybe you'll come running back, baby, from the cruel, cruel world. Almost convince me you're gonna stick around. But everybody knows, Almost doesn't count. So maybe I'll be here. Maybe I'll see you around. That's the way it goes. Almost doesn't count. (S. Peiken/G. Roche)
