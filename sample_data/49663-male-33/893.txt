So, I am in the midst of fighting bank fraud. Someone got/stole/took/saw my credit card number, and started charging away. It was pretty odd stuff. They bought diet pills from TrimLife and DirecTV service, among other things. Fortunately, the bank is being really helpful and guiding me through all the affidavits and new account set up. Bleh! Such fun!
