I just got back from a gala benefit performance of   The Snowman   which is based on the wonderful children's book of the same name. This is the same production I saw back at the tail-end of November & loved. THey've made a few changes/additions & the show is as magical and moving as ever. My friend Phil helped with the benefit today and, as usual, did a spectacular job! I am always so moved by his talents and generosity...it's inspiring. After the show, Phil and I went out to dinner with our friend Jill and her friend Marcie (sp?). I had a blast spending time with them & getting to catch-up with Jill was a special treat.  Tomorrow, I head into technical rehearsals for BILOXI from 1pm til whenever...we'll probably run the whole show twice. Wish me luck!
