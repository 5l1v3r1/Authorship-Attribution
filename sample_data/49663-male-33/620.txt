my big gay life (51)    I may have the gayest job of all: I work non-stop in the world of touring musical theatre.  Hello!  More and more I find that less and less of my gay brethren are working in this field. I ask you:  where  are they? As the companies come rolling into town via train, bus or plane, one fact remais true: the good-looking ones are all straight. Alas, I would not want to find my next date in any crop of singer-dancers on tour. No No No! I learned early on that if you do date them, you may as well be wearing a mirror, because that's all they wanna look at, anyway!  Does this fitted, ribbed nipple-hugging chemise make me look fat?!  No baby...but it may cause you asphyxiation...no one should wear anything lycra that starts out the size of a washcloth. Not to say that all singer-dancers are so self-involved. However, if you can get beneath the surface...the omnipresent cloud of hairstyling products and mound Kenneth Cole shoes littered across the floor, I would be fascinated to know about it. Does the conversation ever leave the realm of glossy magazines, MTV's The Real World and club drugs? Just curious.
