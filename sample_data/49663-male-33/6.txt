THE TAO OF STEVE was quite an engaging, entertaining film! For those who may not know, it is a comedy about applying Taoist principles to dating/hooking-up...and the ensuing chaos it causes. I loved it! At one point it mentions that Love is the national religion of the USA...pretty accurate, don't you think? Love is the opiate of the masses. Or maybe, it's just the pursuit of Love that's the opiate.
