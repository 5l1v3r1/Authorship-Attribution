Wow! Saturday already!  I spent some time visiting my grandmother who is staying with my aunt in Shaker. My friend Kim and I may go out this evening for a little drinking and debauchery...sounds like fun! Guess what? I heard from Joe today. He sent me an IM. Trish is always right...they always come back - even if to just say hello.
