Well...we flew to Philly on Friday morning...we both had flights at 7:40am (alas, not on the same carrier) arriving somewhere around 9am. Trish picked us up and we went to breakfast. Later in the day, we checked in at the Wyndham - wow! nice digs!! Friday night, Matt went to the opera while Trish and I went to Bon Jovi...slightly different, no? Saturday, we walked all around the city and then met Trish for a fashinable late lunch. Later, we met Trish and Kelly for dinner at Orfeo near Rittenhouse Square. Delicious! Sunday, we tried to get Matt back to Cleveland by flying standby, but priceline.com and the airlines don't look too favorably on that - so he was stuck. We returned Monday on separate flights. That's the skeletal breakdown of our weekend. In all, it was great spending time in the city - and great seeing Trish. More later.
