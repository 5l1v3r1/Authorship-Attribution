This weekend was just a little over-the-top as far as my schedule was concerned. Suffice it to say, I did a lot of stuff...as did everyone else, I'm sure during this busy holiday period. One of the nicest moments was spent last evening at my parent's home in Aurora. My grandmother, who is 93 years old, and I unwrapped all of the Christmas ornaments for the tree while my parents were attending a holiday dinner party. It was such a treat to spend the time with her reminiscing as we inspected each ornament...some new and some very, very old. Something like that - something so simple - is all it took to get me into the holiday spirit.
