I am always intrigued when I see search results for this site. Lately, I've been getting a lot of teen-girlie requests on the subject:  Joey+Fatone+girlfriend+pregnant  or  Joey+Fatone+father . Seems like lots of you are worried about the reproductive skills of one of your favorite boyband members. I normally wouldn't have mentioned it, but in the past month, I've seen dozens of the same search request. Just thought it was interesting. How come no one searches  Todd+Stuart+is+a+hottie  ??
