The chronology of a heart undone:    I was dumped last night. I was informed that despite telling me Friday that he only wanted to date me & no one else, somehow by Monday I was not everything he wanted & hoped for in a romantic relationship. Pardon me while I recover from the whiplash of it all. I am trying to decide whether or not to post several of his emails to me in an effort to show you the wonderful romance that was ours. I'm still a little shocked, but I'll be fine. Mamma Doug took care of me last night...cooked me dinner and talked. Of course we had to channel some of my pain into a new song, which actually turned out very well. We're both eager to polish it up. It's titled  It's Time .
