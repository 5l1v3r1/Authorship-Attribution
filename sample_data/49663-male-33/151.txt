It's weird being in a dating relationship again. I mean weird in a "different" (not BAD) sorta way. I mean, I always think I have everything all figured out, and along comes someone who challenges me in completely different ways. Matt is younger - which doesn't factor into our interactions very often. Sometimes, I find him extremely critical/opinionated about music, films, poetry...well...most everything. Like I said before, he's the kind of guy that makes me want to write poetry...the only problem is...I think he'd be critical of it in the end, so why bother. Isn't that screwed-up?!? Maybe that's just a part of his age + nature of his fine arts training. I don't know. Just sounding off...
