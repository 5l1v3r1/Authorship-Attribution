So, anyway...I have to figure out why all my pics weren't posting like I'd asked them to...until then, I'll remove my broken-down link. Today is all about catching-up on errands I couldn't do whilst starring in   urlLink Chicago   for the past 6 weeks...those of you who missed it, I hate you.  urlLink Click here  to  kiss my ass  and apologize and/or grovel for forgiveness. For those of you who actually got off your asses and saw the show (paid good cash-money to see it) and want to see me again...fear not, Fran Weissler has offered me the role of  Billy Flynn  on Broadway, alternating Wednesday matinees at the Shubert. I guess that's when Brent gets his back, bikini and monobrow waxed. Fran has agreed to pay me $400 per show, plus my airfare, so I figure I've got it pretty good for now. So now I get to run around doing ordinary things like dropping off the dry cleaning, mowing the lawn, doing grocery shopping and doing the bills. What a drag (and not in the fabulous, glamorous sense, either you freak)! Well, I hope the rest of you are well on your way to a wonderful weekend! I will be just as soon as I finish this pitcher of Margaritas. Besos...
