I think this may be the longest I've ever gone without posting. My apologies. I had a terrific opening weekend with the play I'm doing  Getting Away With Murder . We had a sold-out show on Saturday! I also had a wonderful date Saturday afternoon. We had lunch at the Clifton Diner and then rented  Lady and the Tramp . He has two Siamese cats named Si and Am...just like the movie, but he had never seen it. We watched the movie, listened to music and spent the afternoon talking & relaxing with each other. I can't remember such a wonderful afternoon/first date ever. He's such a sweet guy...not to mention handsome. Then, on Sunday, I flew to Omaha, Nebraska. Never been before. Probably will never go again. Glad to be back home in Cleveland!
