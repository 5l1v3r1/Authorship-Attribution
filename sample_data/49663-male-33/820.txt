back    Whew! Back from the whirlwind tour of Southern Cali. Special thanks to my friends David, Deidra and Mark for squiring me around for the weekend. Glad to be back home, though. It was especially nice to come home to 80 degree weather and sunshine! So much to catch up on here...but I'll try to post a couple of items here soon.
