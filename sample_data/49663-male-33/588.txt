I walked around the city streets tonight. The pavement wet with the first icy rain of Autumn. Lights reflected and streched disproportionately across the asphalt. The taxi and the bus splashed puddles onto the sidewalk and my khaki pants, belching black diesel exhaust...adding insult to injury. There were no people out, no one walking dogs or visiting on porch stoops. No gossiping and no fighting. No neighbors sitting outside strumming guitars and singing songs of San Juan. No crack-copters overhead. Just me and the slick pavement. Me and my wet shoes and cold feet. My cold feet.
