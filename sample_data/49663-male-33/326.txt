Hello there, handsome! I have been thinking about you, and was so glad to get your email. Did you have a great visit with Eric? I had a terrific weekend, which of course started off beautifully with your sweet card...spent some really nice time with friends after the show Friday. Saturday was relaxing...finally got the cell phone replaced, and visited Doug in the studio. I started work on a new song based on that poem I wrote for you last week, it's tentatively titled "the subject of dreams." Saturday's show was a blast, and I got to spend some quality time with my parents afterward. Yesterday flew by in preparation for the Oscar party...which was wonderful & went off without a hitch. People managed to pile in even with the weather being so bad. All in all, a great weekend!! How about you? What did you and Eric do? Give me all the scoop! I was still planning on seeing you tonight, and even though I have given it tremendous amounts of thought, I still haven't decided what we should do. I'm partial to keeping it low-key. Well, I hope you're having a great day. I certainly am thinking of you & I'm looking forward to seeing you. Write soon, I'm having withdrawal...
