Good news, so far. When I spoke to the nurse this morning, she asked me a battery of questions and then relayed the info to the doctor on duty. He didn't think it was something I needed to be seen for right away, so I made an appointment for Monday afternoon.  Needless to say, I feel quite a bit of relief knowing it doesn't seem to be anything major.
