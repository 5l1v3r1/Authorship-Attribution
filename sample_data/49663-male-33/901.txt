A Letter from Georg: Accidental Correspondent   Good day, my American friends.  I live just to the north of you in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  In the province of Ontario it is now legal for queers to wed.  We were all shocked when the legislation passed, and there are politicians trying to overturn the ruling of course, but for now this is our reality.  I've been with my man for fifteen years (we were very, very young when we met!), but we've decided to hold off on making our union legal...for now.  For us, it's simply not a big deal.  Having said that, I'm glad that the option is there for those who do choose to get married.  When I was a young boy growing up gay in small-town Ontario (I thought I was the only one!), I never thought this day would come in my lifetime!  It seems that things are slowly getting better for my brothers and sisters.   I'm writing to let you know that it is possible to make change - you just have to be willing to work for it.  You have some serious opposition in America, so it won't be easy for you, but I believe that you can win.  Be strong, be focused and be patient.  Keep up the fight!   Yours in Toronto,  Georg.
