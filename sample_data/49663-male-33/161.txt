I am so lit on caffeine right now it's totally not even funny the way I keep running around my office taking things off of the wall and putting new ones on I think maybe it has to do with thye triple morning buzz I ordered at Take 5 Coffee this AM which contains 3 shots of espresso and then the cup is filled to the rim with Brim...just kidding, it's filled to the top with Dark Roast coffee and then a dash of Sweet-N-Low is added and it's topped of with some heavy cream to smooth out the rough edges...
