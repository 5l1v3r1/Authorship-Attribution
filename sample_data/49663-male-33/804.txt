Todds Rambling Journal-like Thoughts on SLC      Saturday  Flight from ClevelandI arrive bleary-eyed and late for the days races. Checked into the Homewood (not Homestead) Suites  whoops! Grabbed the nearest taxi and shot off to the Olympic Oval in Kearns, Utah. I was greeted by Noelle outside of the building, and it was the first time wed had the opportunity to meet in person. Everyone keeps asking me what it was like to meet Noelle after a whole year, but it was delightfully uneventful, which is to say, as natural and comfortable as could be. The person I met was exactly the person I expected. Of course, it was momentous for me to finally meet my Ohno Zone significant other... she was as intelligent and sweet as I had imagined, immediately disarming and looking quite like she just walked off the set of a Dove Soap commercial.       I was overwhelmed just being there. Having the opportunity to watch Short Track live and in person was so exciting, and to do it with so many wonderful fans was a total bonus! I couldnt believe how many Zoners were there cheering on Team USA and speedskating, in general. It was the first time that it dawned on me just how enormous the Ohno Zone had becomea fact that would become more and more evident as the weekend progressed.        Having arrived in time only for the relay, I managed to get the lay of the land, maneuvering around the Media area and meeting lots of enthusiastic fans. Without any sort of mental preparation, Noelle managed to introduce me to Stephen Gough, Yuki and Apolo. Imagine me (one year later and feeling a wee bit ridiculous) face to face with Apolo and Yuki and hoping to god they didnt think I was some freaky, bizarre, over-the-top fan who, at the age of 31, should be well beyond antics like setting up fan websites. I probably was feeling a little self-conscious. NoI definitely was. Sometimes, even though you know its going to happen, you just cant believe it actually will. And, there I wasright there with Apolo, Yuki, Noelle and Stephenmy head almost exploded. If I wasnt so wickedly exhausted, I probably would have had a stroke. Alas, my cooler head prevailed (because the rest of me was asleep). Everyone was extremely polite, but it was evident to me from the beginning that Noelle was the real celebrity hereknown and loved by allI was feeling quite lucky to just stand next to her. Hi, umIm with her     That evening, I was graciously invited to attend the Olympic Anniversary party at Rice-Eccles Stadium, home of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2002 Salt Lake Winter Olympics. It was at this party where I had the chance to meet so many Ohno Zoners. This is the part where I start to get all mushy Imagine setting up this website and never really knowing what would or could happen. Yet, here were all of the people who Id know online for a yearand, do you know what? I couldnt have dreamed of a nicer, better bunch of people. I remain completely impressed and quite entertained. Some of yall are hilarious! I cannot tell you how incredible it was to meet everyone, and I was completely overwhelmed with the warmth and love everyone showed me. Suffice it to say, all the Zoners made me feel like a million bucks that night! I felt like I won the gold medal!    Sunday   This is what Im talking about! A whole day at the Oval watching short track!! Does it get any better than this?!? I loved seeing all the hyped-up fans supporting not only Team USA, but all of the wonderful teams in attendance.         If youve never seen it live, theres nothing like it at all! Its exhilarating, exciting and unbelievably entertaining. Some people make the comparison to NASCAR, but I think its WAY more interesting than thatNASCAR drivers at least have a whole car around them when they crashnot so when youre zooming around the ice. Speaking of crashes, Noelle and I were witness to one spectacular crash involving Juffermans from Netherlands and our own Derek Grey. The impact occurred right under Noelles nose which was both a bit of a shock and oddly thrilling. It looked like Derek had been cross-tracked, but got the DQ anyway. Check out my pre-impact shot of Noelle, dutifully snapping pics.         I still cant get over how much fun 5 hours rink side was! I wish I could go to short track events every week! After Sunday, I became more committed to the idea of supporting speedskating as much as I could. Sure, Apolo will always be a focus there, but the more we can do from the Ohno Zone to hook new fans and new audiences, the better off the whole world of speedskating will be!         Of course, Apolo winning the gold in both the 1000m and 3000m was worth both the trek and the lack of sleep! Do you remember what it was like to watch the races during the Olympicswhere you were somewhere between nauseous and drunk?!? You cant imagine seeing it unfold in front of you, live! Noelle was absolutely right, I came to SLC an Apolo fan, and left as a huge fan of short track!        After the days events, I had a chance to spend some more time listening to Apolo give interviews downstairs. He still amazes me with his grace and determination. I dont know many other 20 year olds who have as much poise. I was well aware that both Noelle and I had the honor and responsibility to represent the Ohno Zone in a professional and respectable manner. After all, we were down there with the likes of NBC, The Seattle Times and APwe had a job to do, and Apolo, Yuki and Team USA expected us to do it well.        Highlights, anyone?   + First, and foremost, meeting Noelle in person was one of the most significant events of the SLC weekend and in my own OZ history. Noelle, you know I can never thank you enough for being my partner in thisI love you.    + Meeting the other webmasters was amazing! I loved spending time with the folks who really understand that, no matter how big a labor of love, running these sites is a lot of endless hard work! You inspire me.   + Meeting Apolo, Yuki and the rest of Team USA was, of course, a major highlightand one I shall never forget.   But the most important highlight (and I tell this to anyone who asks) of the weekend was meeting some of the people who make the Ohno Zone such a thriving and wonderful place. To finally see the faceslike meeting long, lost family members, was an experience I cannot put into words. It was, by far, the most profound part of this whole journey.
