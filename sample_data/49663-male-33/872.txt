the ohio & erie canal towpath    On Sunday, Jeff and I rode about 30 miles along the Towpath Trail, riding from Valley View down to Peninsula and back. It was an ideal day for biking: cool, sunny and clear. The miles seemed to slip by like water, and we were at the turnaround point in just over an hour. There were no major wildlife sightings this time, but I have seen coyote, deer, quail and lots of other varied animals, birds and the like. However, we did see a lot of people wearing spandex and lycra that shouldn't. Anyway, I usually do my long distance rides alone...so I was thrilled to have company along for the journey.
