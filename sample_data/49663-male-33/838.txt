To say that I am exhausted would be an understatement. But, here I am...back at my desk, dutifully plowing through the piles of work. I had a really interesting day at the hospital, and I am looking forward to having a moment to describe it to you. Grandma is still hanging in there..I think she's bored more than anything else.    Phil and a couple of other friends are in the process of auditioning for  Joseph/Dreamcoat , which would make for a fun summer experience. Although, I have to admit, at the moment I'm not feeling too much like it at all. We'll see how I feel later on...   I am committed to bringing Greta's show  Those Seven Little Words  to the stage at Playhouse Square. When we get this thing up on its feet, I hope you'll all come and spend lots of money on tickets, drinks and show-related merchandise! I'm going to be rich, I tell you! Filthy, stinking RICH! Oops, was that my outside voice?! Sorry...   Look for more details here very shortly!!
