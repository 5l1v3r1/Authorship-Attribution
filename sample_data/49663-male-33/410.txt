So, I have this rehearsal tonight for this concert thingy I'm doing for Brecksville. They reunited a couple of their former casts into one big review-type show. So far, it's a big train-wreck. I am so hoping it pulls itself together. My faith is bolstered only by the fact that  Getting Away With Murder  finally hit its stride...and if  that  show could, this one can, too.
