and here we go...    So, the cabaret show rocked! I had a blast watching both sets and getting progressively inebriated with my party gurl  urlLink Rachel . Anyhow, we witnessed amazing gay karaoke...and then some really awful gay karaoke. I managed to not get hauled onto stage to sing.  I suck at karaoke.  But, I totally want to go again next week! The invite's open to y'all if ya wanna go! I promise it's fun!
