It's the dregs. After a full day of sweatshop labor, I have yet another meeting to go to...one that will surely induce lethargy or nausea. I have no hope of emerging from this quorum with any feeling in my limbs. Basically, we're dealing with a mountain of legal mumbo-jumbo and hocus-pocus. I can't stand the stuff, but I guess it helps the world go 'round. Still no activity on both the Dr. Tom and mystery David fronts. However, Other David is doing a little recon work for me. Hopefully, it will return some sort of result. In other news, my dear friend Trish is still in Mexico, skanking it up with some hottie, no doubt. Either that, or completely polluted and baking on the beach. Here's to you, Trish!  I IMed my friend Jennie in the UK today. You all should really get to know her. She likes tomatoes and black-capped Chickadees.
