it is finished    It always comes to this. The final curtain, the last goodbye. It hasn't happened, and yet, I know exactly how it will go...it's always the same. This ending will be bittersweet and cathartic and sad. And when I walk away from that place, it will be a very long time until I go back...and it's merely proximity.
