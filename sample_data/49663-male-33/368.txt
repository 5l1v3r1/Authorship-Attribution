my big gay life (1)    The one rule that always stands true in the smoking wreckage of my love life is this:  they always come back . My ex-boyfriends are as reliable as boomerangs...they dump me and then return to the scene of the crime. Invariably. Unfailingly. Always. Granted, it takes some longer than others, but they always come back. Take, for instance, Joe who unceremoniusly dispatched me after his trip to Barcelona and some sketchy details about a "friend" named Miguel. This past week I started receiving telephone calls and emails from him asking me to contact him. In the end, I finally couldn't take the harassment anymore and called him. He wanted to know if there were any summer internships where I work. Huh. Or even better, more recently, Dan, who decided this week that it would be okay to IM me. Apparently he felt enough time had passed. He said he just wanted to say hello and ask how I was doing and that he'd love it if I would call or email him. Eventually, I had to cut off his keyboard diarrhea. Did I say it was time to start talking again? Did I send out a memo or something?
