Okay, I'll be honest. I've been behaving like an 18 year-old let loose on campus for the first time. For the past 3 nights, I have managed to be at a bar for last call. How immature is  that ?  Thursday, out with the guys, Friday out with MOST of the cast and last night a party for Andrew's 25th + after-party drinking to boot!! I have re-learned about pacing my alcohol intake vs. total time spent. Even so, it's be unforgettable! However, I will say it has been the most fun I've had in a  long  time! The guys in the cast are really a lot of fun & we're having such a great time together!! Today, I'm doing boring stuff like laundry and taxes just to pay some sort of cosmic pennance (sp?) At any rate, today is a day of rest and recovery, contemplation and chores.
