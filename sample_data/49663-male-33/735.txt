Dr. Tom doesn't live here anymore.   Remember last summer's frustrating romantic adventure with Dr. Tom? If not, check the archives...there's plenty-o-bellyaching about it...I just don't feel like linking it at the moment. Anyway, today was move-out day...he's headed back home to Kansas...so that's that. I have no idea who my new neighbor will be, but I'm thinking he may be less messed-up than Dr. T. I do wish Tom well, though...   So, my worlds collided a little this past week. My "L.A. Boyfriend" David, who was the former best-friend of Lee (ex-love of my life), ended up at a party with a certain unnamed minor celebrity (with whom I had a short fling last year). David knew about UMC, but UMC doesn't know that David knows. How entertaining is that?!   Kelly and I are attending a political fundraiser tomorrow evening at the Tree House. Gee, the last time we went to a fundraiser there, I ended up kissing a straight guy (on a drunken dare)...and so did Kelly. Drinks and politics are a very strange mix. She, at least, got a couple of dates out of it...my guy went home to his wife and kids.   After the fundraiser, I have to scoot out to an acoustic performance of some of the material from  urlLink The Sissy Show . Sounds like a goddamned busy day....
