as I was saying...     It's been rough these past few days. Not that spewing out personal details seems to help any, which is why I'm not. I am enjoying the conference and my friends here. Anyway, I guess it's just a low moment. I am prone to the cycles. It will soon pass. God knows I've been down this road before. Tomorrow, I will finish up the conference and head up to L.A. Visiting David, Mark and Deidra will be wonderful, and just what I need.
