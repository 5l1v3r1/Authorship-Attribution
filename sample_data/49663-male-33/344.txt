It's been one of those days! Whew! I am looking forward to going home this evening and relaxing...maybe reading a book or just vegging out watching television - something I don't get to do very often...but it helps when one runs a supposedly pop-culture oriented weblog. I've been inundated with calls regarding  The Lion King  coming to Cleveland in June 2003. Our press announcement yesterday was hectic, but the results were fantastic. We were splashed all over the 5p, 6p, 7p, 11p, 5a, 6-9a and Noon news programs for the past 24 hours AND I got front page of today's Plain Dealer. Not bad for a day's work.
