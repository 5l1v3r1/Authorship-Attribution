Showbiz ain't easy. Late nights and even earlier mornings are the norm. There are a million little details to track, tons of ticket requests and lots of television and radio shows to service with guests and promotions. Every time a show rolls into town, I am reminded how grueling it really is...and how amazing it is to have the chance to work with such incredible people.
