I'm feeling a little overwhelmed. I have all this stuff on my desk...and I know, I know...the voices in my head say to just push it all off the desk and into the trashcan. I wish I could do that. There are these frightening towers of paper and other crap...I mean, work...on my desk...looming over me. I just need to focus and get some of it processed through. I have a complete ad plan I need to finish for  Kiss Me, Kate  and tons of work to be done on this new ballet season we're presenting...plus lots of maintenance on the upcoming tour of  Aida  which arrives here in March. So, I'm just feeling a little stressy. Okay, inhale...exhale. Good. Okay, I'm feeling better. Sometimes, you just have to suck it up and take it. Such is life.    I'm looking forward to my visit to Chicago this week...after all, I'm visiting with the folks at  urlLink Joffrey  and meeting the royalty of  urlLink Chicago's   urlLink blogging   urlLink glitterati . I ask you, what could be better?
