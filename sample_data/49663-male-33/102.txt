The concert was an interesting experience in cultural anthropology. I have never seen so many mullet haircuts in my life. You'd think it was a monster truck rally. I was trying to get an accurate read on the audience. There were truckers and prom queens, advertising execs and theatre queens, bad hair and camel toes. But, the music...the music was great! And hey - the band ain't bad looking, either. After the show, Kelly and I went to one of our old haunts, the Parkview, to check out the Wednesday night blues jam. We ran into one of Kelly's more notorious exes, Kevin. At about 12:30, I peeled her out of there and we both went home and collapsed.
