I think Matt and I may go to  urlLink Cedar Point  this weekend to ride the   Millenium Force   - the world's tallest, fastest most bitchin' rollercoaster. Hopefully, the weather will hold out for us. Keep your fingers crossed. Oh, if you go to the link, you can take a virtual ride of the coaster! It's WAY cool!
