Blogging is a great way to express yourself while honing your writing, journaling and creative talents. I was talking to a friend about blogging, and she was wary of having it out on the internet for anyone to see. I guess, but you always have the choice to share or not to share. You always have the ability to post creative writing or actual facts. Also, there's no law saying you have to use real names. So, get blogging everyone...I'm sure you must have  something  to say!
