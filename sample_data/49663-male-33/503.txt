my big gay life [26]    The thrill and excitement of the Tony Awards has subsided. Life continues on. Where do we go from here? Well, for me, rehearsals are going well...still managing to sing thru my vocal troubles, and things are improving every day. I hope by week's end to be rid of any/all remaining detritus in the vocal cord area. Both my NY peeps (Steve and Charlie) got to go to the Awards at Radio City last night. No word from Charlie yet. For me, my immediate future holds a semi-interesting board meeting. No potential dates lined-up for the week...even though I have no rehearsal til next Sunday! I'd better open up the lil black book and get crackin'! My friend Michelle asked me to join her for the Jimmy Buffett concert on Thursday. We've gone before, and I'm sure we'd have fun. Maybe I can invite a boy along.  Who  will it be?  Who will it be ?
