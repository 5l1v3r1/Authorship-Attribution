So, in true Manly-Man Handbook behavior, I receive this in my batch of morning emails:   hey tod  (sic) ...not sure how you are doing...  hope everything is well...  just wanted to get together sometime soon...  im leaving again for spain in a week or two....    yours,   joe   Huh.  Well, after being only mildly dumbfounded...and not even a wink blown-away, I carefully crafted a very polite/sweet response, thus exonerating me from any potential perceived nastiness and/or leftover bitterness. They always resurface, don't they? Oh, and by the way, we're  NOT  going to be getting together sometime soon...
