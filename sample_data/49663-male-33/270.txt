Todd doesn't do well in the early morning. I was called into a marketing/sales committee meeting of our Board of Directors. Typically, this involves arriving somewhere near pre-banking hours, noshing on generic bagels and sipping either too-hot or too-cool Maxwell House coffee from an industrial-sized brewing device. Invariably, someone will ask a question that will induce healthy eye-rolling on my part. I was not disappointed this morning.
