In my neighborhood, we celebrate  Ghettoween . Ghettoween is a hybrid event which features the synthesis of traditional trick-or-treating, bad costumes, the homeless, mob mentality and occasional gang violence...all squished between the hours of 6 and 8pm. Celebrating Ghettoween requires that you sit out in front of your house in order to pass out candy while avoiding tennis-elbow from opening your front door 350 times...because, believe me, that's how many people stop by on our block. Being in front of your house also allows you to keep an eye on everything going down on the block...from cute 2-year olds dressed as Dorothy, to pre-teens hurling eggs at motorists and passers-by. Keeping a post in front of your house at least lets you see the egg as it hurtles toward your house, as opposed to having to discover it the next morning. Ghettoween is one night a year that really brings the community together...just like All Saints Day, November 1, when we're all back outside bonding...doing things like cleaning up eggs, toilet paper and smooshed candy from our front yards. Hope everyone had a great Ghettoween & I'll see you outside later...broom in hand!
