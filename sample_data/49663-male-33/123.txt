Finally saw Matt yesterday. He spent the night. I barely slept...and not for the reasons you think (get your mind out of the gutter). Not sure why, actually. I hate sleeplessness. Sex would have helped...I always sleep better after...anyway, the TMI siren is going off. Good morning (I'm barely lucid).
