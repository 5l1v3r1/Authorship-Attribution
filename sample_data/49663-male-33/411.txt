Let's see, I didn't really recap my Ft. Lauderdale trip for you. I left early Wednesday morning on a flight that wasn't even half-full, so I got to stretch-out and relax on my journey south. Jim, my boss, and I stayed at the  urlLink Radisson Bahia Mar , which is located right on A1A and the beach! You couldn't imagine a nicer location for some industry meetings. We managed to get a few hours in the sun at the beach and at the private pool. We enjoyed a leisurely casual dinner across the marina at Bahia Cabana, watching the yachts slip in and out of the Middle River. They say the marina sees more than $500 million dollars worth of vessels every year. We then hit the Greyhound Racetrack in Hollywood, Florida, for a few races. I managed to win $16. The next day was filled with meetings and reunions, as we all said hello to friends and colleagues from across the country. We enjoyed a nice evening cruise up the Middle River, a tour of the Broward Center and dinner at this really fantastic riverside restaurant that I don't remember the name of....My flight home on Friday was sold-out. Packed to the gills...and late. As always, it was great to get home, but I really miss the warmth, the green and the ocean...
