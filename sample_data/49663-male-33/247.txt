I hobbled home last night after work. I ached. I was suffering dementia and exhaustion and sugar-shock. I took aspirin. I drank chamomile-lemon tea. The aching gave way to heavy slumber (much needed). Greeted in the morning by snow reflecting the white/gray/silver sky. Painless. I readied for work. Another brutal day.
