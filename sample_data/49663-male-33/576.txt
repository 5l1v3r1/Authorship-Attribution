Crap! Time for another rural respite. Starting tonight, I'm house/dog sitting for my friend Phil. He lives out in Russell...so I'm going to be climbing the walls in short order. Who knows, maybe there'll be some hunky cornfed Midwestern farm boys to keep me company. At least I'll get to see my boy Rusty (Phil's dawg)...kinda looks like a bigger  urlLink Dex .
