Capsule of the past week or so: broke-up with Joe, went to Williamsburg with Trish, missed a rehearsal, missed  two board meetings, Grandma went into hospital - then was released with minor pneumonia, Jennifer (my co-worker) gave birth to her second child, Isabelle May, Dad was offered a rad new job starting in January, my sister's ex is up to some legal antics re: custody and my Xmas show opens tonight. What more can I possibly pack into such a short time?????
