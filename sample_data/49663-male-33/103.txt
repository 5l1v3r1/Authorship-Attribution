I received a package today! I love presents! My friend Trish and Kelly sent me a FedEx full of goodies, which include: two videotapes of my vacations with Trish AND a video copy of my performance of TWILIGHT OF THE GOLDS. Also, Kelly sent me the new Jim Brickman CD which I have been wanting to purchase. Along with all of this, I received two cards, and I can tell you this: there is nothing better than the love and adoration of friends! (Well, except for chocolate mousse) Thanks, guys!!
