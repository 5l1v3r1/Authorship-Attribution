Sometimes things just get weird. Like yesterday. I find out that a friend of many years has suffered an apparent stroke and is in the ICU at a local hospital. Talk about a sudden shift in perspective! I don't know too much about his status, other than he's paralyzed on the right side of his face...which may be temporary. I am planning on going to visiting hours this evening to see what I can find out.     update   Well, I got to spend about 8 - 10 minutes with Bob before the nurse kicked me out for not being "immediate family." Apparently, the steady stream of folks up to the ICU has made the unit a little testy. So, they kindly gave me a few minutes and then booted me, ever so politely, out of the ward. Bob has very little use of his facial muscles right now, but the docs are hopeful for his recovery. More later...
