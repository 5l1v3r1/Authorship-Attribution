my big gay life [30]   I had a great weekend, I did...I did lots of stuff outside...actually got some color (which looks  good , by the way). Rachel and I really enjoyed the show on Saturday. Afterwards, we went to Johnny Mango's for a drink or two and a bite to eat. Sunday was a day of cleaning, shopping and more sunbathing. I got nothing major accomplished, except weeding my flowerbeds.In the evening, I decided to stay at home to watch  urlLink Sex and the City  and  urlLink Queer As Folk  with Kelly and Rachel.
