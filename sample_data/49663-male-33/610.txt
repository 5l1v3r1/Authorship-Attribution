Do you think it's possible to eradicate this cold I'm coming down with? I mean, I'm using every bit of organic & whole foods knowledge that I can get my hands on. I just juiced a lemon, a lime, one grapefruit, an orange and an apple into one hell of a vitimin C cocktail. Either my insides will dissolve due to the massive amount of citric acid, or this cold is a goner! Either way, I'll report the results tomorrow.
