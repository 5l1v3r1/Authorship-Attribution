Trish says we are going to see NSYNC...again (for the 3rd time this year) in Philly. Apparently, she just can't get enough of our favorite teen-pop sensation. Especially now, when we need to be concentrating on the new Backstreet release...we shouldn't be distracted by all this NSYNC stuff. It's time to focus...focus on the BBoys...go on...focus...
