I am going to work in the studio tonight with my friend Doug. ..cleaning up more of the work we did last week. I am really looking forward to hearing all the improvements he's made. I guess our friend Joni did a great back-up take on "Missed the Train" that I'm curious to hear. All in all, it's been a terrific day! Not to tease, but I think tomorrow I'll do a new post from the  urlLink EMeRGe  mailbag.
