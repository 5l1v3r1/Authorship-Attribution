I was walking with Charlie in the gutters of the idling steel mill. One one side of the murky, coffee-colored river was the old Republic Mill, churning and screeching, spewing molten ore, spewing the rhetoric of a core industry taken for granted, passed-by for things shinier and fast. On our side, quiet and steam. The hum like a nuclear reactor, a sleeping giant waiting to come back to life. The West Side Mill is on "hot-idle," meaning it's easier to get back into steel production than if it was completely shut down. So, it idles there, waiting to reawaken, waiting to forge ahead...waiting to deliver cold, hard steel, paychecks and dreams, college educations and IRA's. The few trees remaining around the mills, or those stubborn enough to take root after the place was built, drop leaves in the autumn chill, others cling desperately to branches. A brown dust has settled over everything, and it's hard to imagine anything ever being clean.
