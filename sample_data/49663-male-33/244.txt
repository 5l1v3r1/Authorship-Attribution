Tonight I go back to  Getting Away With Murder  rehearsal. I hope to have a better grasp of the abilities of the cast. I am concerned, thus far, to say the least. Upon our first read-thru, it appears we have a few illiterate boobs who may be completely void of any acting talent whatsoever...especially since Elliot Hooper (from  Biloxi ) had to drop out. I am  deathly  worried about the quality of the show.
