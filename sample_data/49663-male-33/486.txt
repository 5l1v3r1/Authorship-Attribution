The clouds looked ominous this morning as I stumbled out of bed...not actual clouds, mind you...but the fake scary ones I conjured in my head. Anyway, I woke up with a slight headache, which worsened as I approached my office. I drank lots of water and popped two aspirin to see if I could slay the beast before it debilitated me. I lost. Sitting at my desk going over my morning's agenda, a wave of nausea hit me. I grabbed my theater key and let myself into the darkened and quiet Allen Theatre. I raced up to the mezzanine level men's room, and arrived just in time. Thankfully, I had nothing in my system this morning except water and two asiprin tablets.  Note to self: this is not a great way to start the day.
