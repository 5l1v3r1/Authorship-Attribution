meetings are fun.   Here in Manhattan, everything is more fun than in the boring, old provinces. Even meetings. We're about 25 people, in all, huddled around a marble conference table in a beautiful room somewhere deep inside Lincoln Center. We talk of successes, disasters, ticket sales and swap ideas, strategies and jokes. But more than that, when the meetings are over, we are in one of the most amazing cities in the world...everything at your fingertips. Even though things get rocky every now and then, sometimes it takes trips like this to pop me out of the rut...get me away from the maelstrom if even for only a few days. Things look just a bit better from this perspective. And that's good.
