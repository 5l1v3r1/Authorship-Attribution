I had a great chat with Trish last night. I explained to her that I really wasn't experiencing the typical whirlwind/cyclone/rollercoaster emotional reaction that I had anticipated in this particular break-up situation. Instead, it's like a slow, gentle hum. Kinda like how you can only hear the refrigerator when the house is quiet...it's like that. There seems to be a consistent and constant stream of low-level sadness...which is extremely manageable. I let myself feel it, but it's not distracting me. Daily reminders of him don't seem to plunge me into the pit of dispair. My mind has moved onto thoughts of new experiences, people and places. Life is pretty good, and when surrounded by the overwhelming abundance in my life...it's hard not to feel like the luckiest guy on the planet. Maybe it's better to count your blessings than to dawdle on useless bad feelings? Anyway, if you're reading this, Blogger must be cooperating...
