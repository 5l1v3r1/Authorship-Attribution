So, last night, I was all zoned out...a natural response to searing chronic pain, I suppose, and I couldn't think of anything else. However, after a good night's rest, I feel a little more human. I still have pain, but I'm hoping the Advil does the trick (heh-heh, I said "trick"). Sorry for all the whining and haiku.
