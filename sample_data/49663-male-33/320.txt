Sorry today's post is so late! I had  Biloxi Blues  brush-up rehearsal last night. Afterwards, 4 of us went our for  a  beer. Well, 6 shots and 2 beers later, it was 1:30 in the morning...and we all knew we'd be hurting. However, Andrew, Brian, Jeffrey and I had such a great time bonding, laughing and telling stories we'd do it again tonight...maybe  we will do it again  tonight. What a blast! It was one of those rare opportunities to look into the guarded secret world of the hetero male. Fascinating and humorous!!
