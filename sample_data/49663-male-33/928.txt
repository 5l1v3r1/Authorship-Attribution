I have one of those sleep hangovers. You know, the kind where you sleep so well that when you wake up, you feel like you're  still sleeping. After a busy weekend, it was harder to kick into gear this morning. Spent Friday working in the yard and getting it ready for planting season, and took Toby on a nice long walk at Edgewater Park. We both enjoyed the sunshine and the relatively mild weather. Saturday, more errand-running, dog walking and catching-up with Tivo. We went out drinking/dancing at the Grid with some friends from work, and finished off the night with breakfast at 4am. Easter rolled around a little too soon, but we managed to recuperate for a bit before heading out to my parents for dinner. Had fun playing a raucous game of hide and seek with my 9 year old nephew. That's the brief. I'll think of something more to write later...I gotta go look at some Excel speadsheets or something.
