Okay so I have decided to give the Sade tickets to Kelly who will invite Tom, Ed and Greg from across the street, unless Steve comes up from Columbus. I'm sure I'll get to see the show once they release it on DVD. In other concert news, I also just snagged two VIP Box Seats and backstage parking for John Mellencamp & The Wallflowers show on August 30. It's going to be a wedding gift to Laurie and Scott who were married at the end of July. What else? It seems that new musical I workshopped two years ago still has life in her...The Sissy Show will head out on the road again, this time to Yale, in conjunction with a conference on gender and sexuality in October. So, Todd's touring again. I'll post as details become available. I finished lyrics to a new song yesterday and shipped them off to Doug for his two cents, and I can't wait to get back into the studio to work on it.
