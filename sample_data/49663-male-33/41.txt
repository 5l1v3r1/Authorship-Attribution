Matt is flying home from NYC today, and I am due to pick him up at  8:02 this evening. It'll be great to see him again...any excuse, right?  :)   Between now and then, I might go to the studio to do some recording with Doug...we'll see. More welcomes to the endless hordes of folks checking into E M e R G e  from Western Australia! What is it that makes this blog so appealing to our Aussie friends?   G'Day!
