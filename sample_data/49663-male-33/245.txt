I guess it has been a few days. The whirlwind week finally wrapped-up, and I was free to do a few of the things that I like to do..sleep and party.  BILOXI  was a knockout this weekend with fantastic audiences and great performances by everyone in the company. Friday night saw most of the cast and crew go out immediately following the show. Some of us stayed out until 3 AM or so...I'm not saying  who ...Saturday was just as much fun & a ton of friends, family and neighbors caught the show. I spent Sunday visiting with my friend Margaret and watching silly movies and reading. All in all, an excellent end to a frightful week. So far, this week looks like an absolute delight in comparison!
