I just had a delightful conversation with Lee! He's doing well in Miami, and has met a terrific new boyfriend named Rodney. They are moving in together within the next two months, partially an economic move because Lee is so "poor" right now. Rodney sells cellular communications service in South America, so he travels frequently, but Lee says they've been able to spend a good amount of time together. Lee seems truly happy and settled into his life...something I haven't seen in a long time.
