I spoke to my friend Abra this morning. I met her on the National Tour of MISS SAIGON this past season, and she has become a wonderful friend, along with Tiffini. They were the Company Managers for the now defunct tour. Abra is now the Asst. Company Manager of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA on Broadway, and Tiffini is Company Managing a new show in California (for now). It was great catching up with her. Hopefully, we'll get to see each other soon.
