if it's Tuesday, it must be Charleston   Pardon my absence. I've been traveling a lot lately. Last week, I visited Charleston, South Carolina, for business. I had an opportunity to really enjoy myself for an extra day or so. Who wouldn't love a city like that? Old Southern charm, lots of European influence, great cultural scene, lots of terrific restaurants and clubs, wonderful shopping and gorgeous weather...not to mention the living history of the place. After spending four days at home, it was time to jet off to Toronto with my friend Phil. We had planned this trip for over New Year's, but Buffalo, New York, got snowed-in, so we decided not to chance it. We are having a great time up here (posting from Canada now) shopping, walking, drinking, etc. It's a nice getaway inthe middle of a very hectic quarter at work. Anyhow, I know it's been awhile since I wrote, but I promise there's more to come...
