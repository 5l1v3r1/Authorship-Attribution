my big gay life (11)    Yesterday was incredible! A total gift! The sun was high and bright, and the temperature remained a very agreeable 70 degrees. Our hike lasted just shy of 3 hours, and we were delirously exhausted by the end of it. We drove into Peninsula to have an early dinner at The Winking Lizard, and then drove back to the city, sated. I took a shower, dressed and went over to DVDave's for the weekly Queer As Folk party. We're watching Further Tales of the City until QAF comes back from hiatus in a month. All in all, a really terrific day.
