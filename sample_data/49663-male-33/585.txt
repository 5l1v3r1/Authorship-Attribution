all's well in Ward 17   I went to a candidates' night event at St. Colman's Church in my neighborhood last evening. There's an exciting political race brewing here in my Ward...a longtime incumbent decided to give up his seat, and now we've got four candidates duking it out for the job. One of the candidates is Buck Harris, my next door neighbor, and the former host of the radio show I produced and co-hosted for 5 years. I have to admit that I was very skeptical when he announced his candidacy, but after listening to him in a totally different context last night, I have to say I'm extremely impressed! Also impressive was Julie Candela who is running a phenomenally relevant campaign with less than 6,000 bucks. I was disappointed by Matt Zone, who, at 38, has managed to amass the support of the political machine here in Cleveland. There's nothing wrong with him, per se, but there's something off about him. Too slick maybe. So, our primary is Tuesday, Oct. 2. We'll whittle it down to two...and then it's going to get good! Outside of passing out a few flyers, I've never really participated in any of this campaign stuff. It was great to see a packed meeting hall...people out really concerned with the political process in their own backyards. So, did I change my mind about the candidates last night? Yep. Now at least I know who I'm not voting for...
