Well, it was an early morning today. I had to do some early morning publicity with Santa and the Rockettes from Radio City's Christmas Spectacular...who just announced they are coming to Cleveland this December. Anyway, we had a couple of interviews, and then the big announcement back at one of our theatres. Now, I am playing catch-up and trying to avoid any incoming ex-boyfriends. Ack! Anyone got any advice on this recurring boyfriend thing?
