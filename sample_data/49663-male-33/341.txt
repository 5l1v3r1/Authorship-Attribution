For my fellow Taureans today: Taurus  Look backward as well as forward. Your accomplishments have a direct bearing on your destination. There's no need to repeat what you've already done. Move on with cheer and efficiency. Even if that latest thing you were involved with and so dedicated to didn't come off as you would have liked, you still learned a lot and gathered quite a bit of wisdom from your efforts. In the future, you will be more polished and able to take the bull by the horns, wrestle him to the ground and get him to do things your way.
