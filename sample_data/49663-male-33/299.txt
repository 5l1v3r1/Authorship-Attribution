About ten of us from work went out last night. We went to a really fun local dive called The Patio. Then, someone thought it would be a good idea to go dancing at Europa. So, in a caravan of random vehicles, we made our way to Europa. We had been in the club for no more than five minutes when the SWAT team showed up and busted down the entire club. Perhaps the most frightening aspect was that they turned the lights on in the club...never a pretty sight. We were told to stand up against the bar...or face down on the dance floor. We waited while everyone was frisked, and in my case, frisked twice. They were looking for drugs and underage drinking, I think. In the end, everyone in our party made it out okay. In happier news, Kelly had a terrific first date with Cameron.
