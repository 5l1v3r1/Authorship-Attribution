The board meeting was a bit long tonight, but I have no one else to blame but myself (as chair of the Production/Tech. Council). However, we had 19 people show up...which is good...although not necessarily efficient. I had a nice chat with my mother tonight about Grandma and her condition...she just moved back into her apartment after living with Mom + Dad, and then my Aunt, for the past 10 weeks. I am seriously considering going to the Appalachian Trail Biennial Conference this July. It's being held at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania - near Harrisburg. There will be meetings, breakout sessions and hiking the Trail! It sounds like a good place for a AT enthusiast and beginner like me. That's all for tonight...see you tomorrow!!
