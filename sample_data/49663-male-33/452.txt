my big gay life (13)   I received an invitation via email today from a good friend inviting me to a party this Saturday to benefit the local Lesbian & Gay Community Service Center. Immediately, I remembered a comment Dan made weeks ago about being CC'd on the same emails, but never really knowing each other well. He wondered how many times had we received these group emails from our mutual friends without even knowing it. I say this because we are both recipients of today's email. So, the question that begs asking is:  do I go to the party ? I am fairly certain he'll be there if for no other reason than the slight chance I might be there. I'm gonna need help with this one. What do you think I should do?  urlLink email me .
