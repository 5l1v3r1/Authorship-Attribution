clouds in my coffee...   It was that song  Fast Car  by Tracy Chapman that did it. I was swirling the cream in my coffee this morning when I heard it wafting from the sound system above me. Immediately, I was back in high school, talking to Ken and Matt about being in a fight in downtown Cleveland. It was the day after Thanksgiving, and we were downtown for the Christmas lighting ceremony...3 high school boys wandering around the city. On our walk back toward Public Square, we were approached by two city boys (roughly our age) who announced that they were thugs..."thugs that mug." Well, Ken and Matt were both on the wrestling team, so they were set and ready. However, the only fighting I'd ever done was choreographed as part of  West Side Story . What was I going to do, fend them off with showtunes? In the end, nothing much happened, there was a mini-smackdown on the sidewalk, a brief chase up into the crowded square and a quick disappearance of the "thugs...thugs that mug." We were all safe and uninjured...just a little ruffled around the edges. I'm sure Tracy Chapman would hate that  Fast Car  reminds me of a downtown skirmish, but I'm always startled at how immediately I am transported by music...and there I was...downtown on a frozen November night some thirteen years ago..with the world spinning beneath me.
