I've been  moody  these past few days. Maybe it's just exhaustion from final rehearsals, maybe it's a slow-creep depression that has wallowed-up around me. For whatever reason, I'm feeling  crappy  today...and I shouldn't. I mean, it's opening night, tonight. Granted, it's a two-bit piece of fluff/garbage, but it has provided a decent distraction from the whole Dan situation. I would say, with some certainty, that I am doing better every day. It's not that I think about him less, I am just learning to think about him differently. I very much want to be able to be friends, I just don't know how that works from this vantage point. I need to get to a place where I can be open and honest, without feeling the pangs of separation. I've done it before. I can do it again. I'll wait until I know I'm really ready. I do miss him. I miss him very much.  Oh l'amour ...
