Did I mention that I smashed my finger in the car door last night? (Yo soy dumbass) Now, my right thumb has an ugly reddish-blue stripe running the vertical length of my thumbnail. Ack! Now I'm  flawed . Will anyone recognize me with this hideous claw? Will people recoil? I guess I'll slap a Band-Aid on it and go do the show. In other news, the pollen index is way off the charts here in Russell Township. If I didn't have allergies before (and I didn't) I certainly do now. No hunky country boys to speak of yet...well...that's not true. I guess  I'm  here. I miss being at my house in the city...my cute little Victorian neighborhood and all of my big gay neighbors. I miss Toby, too. He can't stay here with me and Rusty because Rusty would devour him as a snack, so, Tobester gets to lounge in the city with housemate Kelly.
