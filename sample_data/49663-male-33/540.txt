I'll have to make this snappy...I'm getting ready to head out on an overnight excursion with my dad, uncle Bob and cousins Bill and Scott. We're going to a resort area on western Lake Erie called (strangely) East Harbor to spend the night and then go fishing tomorrow morning. Okay, all of you can stop laughing. No, I don't know crap about fishing...but Uncle Bob gave this to me as one of my Xmas presents and, well, I couldn't exactly refuse, could I? I'm hoping it's lots of fun and will provide me with a little Blogger material. Please don't worry about me while I'm away, I've packed plenty of showtunes and a waterproof purse. Anyway...last night after my dinner with Phil and the gang, I picked up Kel and we went to the Market Ave. Wine Bar and then to Duck Island Club. At Duck Island, I ran into some old friends and Joe (the big scary ex from last year). Very eventful evening, very alcoholly...didn't feel so great this morning. All better now, though. See ya when I'm back from fishin' !!
