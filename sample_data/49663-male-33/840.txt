it sprawls out before us    I can't believe how gorgeous it is outside at the moment. I am slamming this entry out before I dash out to spend the balance of the day on the trails. Toby and I are heading out into the wilderness to hike, and we won't be back til sundown. Funny things happen when we go out hiking. Sometimes it's Zen-like, sometimes it's like food poisoning...either way, we're out of the house.
