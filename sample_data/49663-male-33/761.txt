a beautiful night for flying...    I flew on United Airlines today from San Juan to Chicago, and Chicago to Cleveland. I was proud to take to the skies today. On any other day, it's insignificant. Today...it mattered. I am glad to be home and will be excited to update you on my vacation. For now, I'm settling back in, ever thankful for the many blessings in my life...
