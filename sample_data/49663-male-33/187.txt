Several things: I just received a wonderful goody-package from my friend at JIVE Records. Included are several new Backstreet Boys CDs (yes, the new release) and a couple copies of the JIVE "Platinum Christmas" album...featuring Britney, Christina, NSYNC, Santana, Dido, TLC and Miss Whitney. Sounds like freakin' unbelieveable smattering of holiday happiness. Also: an EMeRGe welcome to Erika from somewheres around VEGAS!! (Hey, I said VEGAS, people! Let's get up and show some respect for Erika and her peeps!) Anyhoo...she reminded me that the very first story on this website is the most popular one...How I got cruised by NSYNC...and that if YOU are interested in reading it, go to the archives and click on August. It's the VERY FIRST entry ever posted. Read it...it's a HOOT and it's absolutely 100% true...you can ask my friend  urlLink Trish . She'll verify! Anyhoo...Erika wrote a wonderful email to yours truly, and I have not stopped laughing yet, so THANK YOU, Erika!  ::::kiss kiss kiss:::
