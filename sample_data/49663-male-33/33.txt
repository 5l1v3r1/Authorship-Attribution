Well, it is that time of the year to be thinking about Halloween costumes. I am insisting that my friend Rachel gets blond extensions for her hair and that she goes for the whole "grunge-slut" Christina Aguilera look. On the other hand, I need to find 4 other guys so we can go as a boy band. I'm not sure if we should go as a particular band, or just make one up. I'll keep you posted.
