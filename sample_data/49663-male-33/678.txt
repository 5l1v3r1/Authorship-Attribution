Weird day at work. We've managed to cultivate an overwhelming culture of panic. Lots of unnecessary freaking out today by lots of different people (I'm being deliberately vague). Suffice it to say, we have way too much work on our plates and we're paying for it now in bundles of stress and anxiety. So, what the hell am I doing updating my blog, you ask? In a word: sanity. I have decided to remain absolutely calm against the hurricane of chaos which has descended upon our cubicles. I found myself becoming defensive and making snarky comments, so I decided I needed to adjust my attitude and maybe everyone else will too. I'm going to work late tonight and complete all of my many tasks so that tomorrow won't be overwhelming at all.  There is no rehearsal tonight, so I'm glad for the opportunity to rest my voice and catch-up with other daily mundane stuff like laundry and grocery shopping. Did I mention that I think I'm going to wear a wig? And blue colored contacts? Yep.
