Why do my ex-boyfriends always feel the need to keep in touch? Does this happen to anyone else? Particularly perplexing are the calls and emails from the ones who dumped me...didn't they want out in the first place? As my friend Trish will tell you, I have this particular plague: after a breakup (no matter how big or small) out of the clear blue weeks later...I get calls, emails...you name it.
