Well, I have returned...alive...and no worse for the wear. However, we learned upon arrival in Toledo that this competition was not, in fact, a competition. No, no no...it was simply a festival to showcase our "amazing" talent. Well, if we fucking KNEW that in advance, we wouldn't have FUCKING hauled our asses all the way to Toledo. I suspect the other entries would have done the same - which is why they didn't tell anyone. Our excerpt went very well, we sold out the theatre for our performance. Apparently, the rest of the regions had heard about our little show. Anyway, as predicted, we hit the mark...there was laughing, yelling, tenderness and even tears on cue! I love it when it all works. Anyway, there were some sort of individual awards being handed out today, but we all left so we could get home and enjoy what was left of our Labor Day holiday. So, now I contemplate making a quick visit with my family for the evening. At any rate, I shall report back when I know anything re: awards.
