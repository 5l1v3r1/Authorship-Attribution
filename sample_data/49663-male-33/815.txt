that's sooooooo gay.    So, after seeing Greta's show this past weekend, I learned that she and her cohorts perform weekly at  urlLink The Grid . Every Wednesday, they do a cabaret/piano-bar type of show. Apparently they rehearse and perform a new show weekly! I am going to go check them out tonight...if you are interested, they do their sets at 6pm and 7:30pm. I'll be there enjoying the discounted cocktails and free tacos! Woo-Hoo!!! So, please join me tonight if you wanna! I'd love to see you!
