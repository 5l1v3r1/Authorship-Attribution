moving day    Very good news! Grandma is leaving the hospital today, transferring over to an assisting-living/rehab clinic for another week or so of therapy. I am so happy for her...she's been at Metro for almost 6 weeks. Progress does not come quickly for a 95 year old woman, but to her credit, she meets every challenge with tenacity and spirit. She still has a long road ahead, but she is healthy enough to be released from the hospital...and it's a relief for all of my family.
