A reminder, dear readers, that the series you are reading titled  unravel in 58  is a way for you to join me on my journey through my lastest dating experience. I have no malicious intent. Rather, I want you to see what a terrific guy Dan is, and why I fell for him...and why it felt like the rug got pulled out from underneath me...and why I miss him...and why I must move on...in any case, thanks (as always) for reading and responding.  Yours,  Todd
