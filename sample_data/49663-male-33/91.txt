I forgot to mention...last night (around 10pm) a bouquet of freshly cut flowers appeared, mysteriously, on the windshield of Kelly's Jeep. There was no note, and it was only tied together by a red bandana. For the life of me, I can't figure out who would leave flowers on a Jeep in the middle of the night with no note. Neither one of us can figure it out. I wanted to think they were for me, but the windshield of my car bore nothing more than birdcrap.
