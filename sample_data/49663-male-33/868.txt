words spoken   Lately, I've been speaking. I was asked to make a toast at Michelle & Eric's wedding last week, and even though I am a veteran public speaker, it still made me nervous. Isn't that weird? My mother would also like for me to say a few words at Grandma's memorial service this Sunday. I think Grandma is now the world-record holder in delayed cremation. Let's see...she passed on August 9, and today is...  Well, the memorial service is the 28th...small private affair. Of course I have a zillion things to say, but when the moment comes, I wonder if it'll be tough. I want to be able to say something sweet and significant to her memory without choking up and becoming a giant mess. I'm sure it's possible...but not probable.  When I was house sitting for my parents this past weekend, I had to mess with their answering machine (I thought I broke it) and found that my mother has saved lots of messages...most of them adorable verbal missives from her 8 year old grandson. I was skipping my way through them and ran across the voice of my second grade teacher, Mrs. Munn, who just passed away this past month. Then, a message or two away was the voice of my grandmother, calling in from the hospital asking how the doctor's appointment went for Marissa and Zachary (two of her great-grandchildren and my niece and nephew). It was simple, but amazing to hear her voice...captured on tape. All at once, it was if she was there in the room. I shut off the answering maching half alarmed and half thankful that Mom had saved it.  They are just words...but they were her words...and they reminded me about her sweet, ever-vigilant and loving concern for all of us. Thanks, Mom, for not deleting that...
