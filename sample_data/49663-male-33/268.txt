Oh, dear readers,  what to say ? Am I in a  mood  today or what?! (trust me, I am!) Most likely, it stems from me having to get up a full  hour and a half earlier  than I normally do...which is  extremely  punishing. Take away my sleep...and you take away my humanity. I am hoping to get out of here today without chewing off someone's head...
