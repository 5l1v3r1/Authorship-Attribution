my big gay life [16]   Lord help us! Imagine, if you will, 3 gay guys and one gay-friendly...all descending upon the baseball stadium tonight to see the big game. There's something inherently comical about the 4 of us going to this game. I mean, my friend Pat is a total spaz. He refers to himself as a "Ziegfeld Girl," and it seems to suit him. I can just imagine him in the old days with Florenz working on his time steps or Buffalo shuffles. Anyway, we're going to the game tonight. Going to a game at Jacob's Field is the ultimate eye-candy experience...not only are lots of the ballplayers hunk-a-licious, but the 41,000 other fans (80% male) make the man-scoping ratio  very  attractive. So, the plan is to meet at The Winking Lizard behind the stadium at around 4:45 or 5pm. I won't get there until 5:30 because of work, but I'll just have to catch-up faster. I'm thinking a nice beer buzz would feel great on a gorgeous night like tonight. So, I think a night out with the boys will be just what the doctor ordered! I'm really looking forward to having a terrific night. I guess we have great seats, too....right behind the dugout along the third base line. If you watch the Indians game on television tonight, look for me...I'll be the tall, dark and handsome one squished between a Ziegfeld Girl, a Bear and the homo wannabe. Cheers!
