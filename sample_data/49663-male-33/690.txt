so, the week's flown by and I haven't really made many updates (my apologies to Kelly and other frequent unextraorinarians) but I've been whacked-out on caffeine and staying up way too late at night and rehearsin' and cursin' and lots of other stuff. But, JCS is going very well and I'm trying to be on my best behavior...not going out and getting wasted nightly, not hanging around smoky bars and definitely not huffing glue or turpentine. On the other hand, I am being hyper-vigilant about laughing, staying in touch with friends and drinking coffee and/or Coke. I love Coke.    Yesterday, being all valentiney and whatnot, I managed to accumulate a surprising number of people who agreed (after some cajoling) to be mine...well, for yesterday, at least. Anyhow, it made me realize how many very cool/wonderful people I have in my life. I got to spend time with Kelly last night watching  urlLink The Vagina Monologues  and drinking wine. I spoke with my friend David in L.A. and Lee in Miami...and best of all...a voicemail from Brandon to start my day. Geez guys, thanks for being so sweet.     Heading off to Oz tonight after a quick visit to Dr. Hottie (chiropractor), and then to a soiree at Miss Ricki's (she's our Dorothy). Ciao!
