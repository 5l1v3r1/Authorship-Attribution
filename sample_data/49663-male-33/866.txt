crack copter   They were buzzing around the city tonight like oversized flies, circling and shining their halcyon search lights. They tend to dart around the airspace in my neighborhood with regularity. Their beams have even swept across my lawn and house, looking for whatever. Every time I see them up there I can't help but wonder what they're doing...my curiosity gets the best of me. Kelly and I started calling them crack copters because we assumed they were looking for drug activity...but who really knows?
