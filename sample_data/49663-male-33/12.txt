I was trying to find someone - anyone - who knows anything at all about dream analysis. What would the Space Shuttle symbolize? What about that aircraft carrier in the middle of the small lake? ANyway...I'm still waiting on the analysis portion of the dream. I'll share all the details just as soon as they're avail. I leave for Boston tomorrow. I hope that BLAST! show is entertaining. I have to go and check it out for work. Not bad, eh? I wonder if my flirty superpowers will work in that area code? Last night, I went to see the Tammy Faye documentary at our local art theatre. Wow! What a scream! RUN, don't walk! Go see this flick! It's narrated by RuPaul...yet another cool feature. Trust me, it's worth whatever they're charging.  (more later, I think)
