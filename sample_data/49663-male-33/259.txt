I keep having this overwhelming sense of doom that the rolling blackouts in California will somehow disable  urlLink Blogger . Egads! What would we all do? So, in an event of a power-outage in  urlLink San Francisco , I have made a list of alternate activities for stranded Bloggers: 1. clip fingernails. 2. clean lint and other detritus from mouse roller-ball. 3. dust your monitor and cpu. 4. try channeling Bill Gates. 5. read something other than a monitor. 6. practice telekinesis (moving stuff with sheer mental power). This is just a simple list to help get you started. No doubt, you'll come up with more. Now, just  who  thought it was a good idea to have all the servers located in California? Omaha looks good right about now...
