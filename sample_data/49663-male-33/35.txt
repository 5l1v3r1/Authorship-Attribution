Matt and I are going to see the Barenaked Ladies concert tonight at Gund Arena (say it real fast and it sounds like a venereal disease). We scored tix in a private loge from a friend of mine. Hopefully, it'll be a great show! I've heard that BNL is wonderful live. This will also be one of the first "pop" concerts Matt has ever attended...he's always going to those classical concertos and stuff. Won't this be a change?!
