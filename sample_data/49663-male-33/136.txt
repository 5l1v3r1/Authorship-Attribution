We had to get up today at 6:45am. This, even in theory or hypothesis, is horrifying to me. We did it, though. Matt needed to get to campus early for one of his exams. He's quite difficult to rouse from slumber, but I was proud of him for actually getting to the car by 7am. I returned and promptly went back to bed until 8:30. So I shoed up at work a little late? Who cares?! I need sleep or else I am a BEAR to deal with!
