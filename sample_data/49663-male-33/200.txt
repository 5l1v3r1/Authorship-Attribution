Bookmakers have placed their bets on popster 'virgin' BRITNEY SPEARS giving birth next year.   The Jack Brown Group are offering odds of 25-1 on the virginal singer to have a baby in 2001. But Britney's record company, Jive, says it is highly unlikely the teen star will follow idol, Madonna's footsteps and become a mum in the near future. A spokesperson said, "I would not put any money on it." Oh - imagine a mini Justin 'n' Britney running around...on seconds thoughts, don't, it could ruin your new year!
