Let's see...yesterday was absolutely crazy for me. I went from work right into our annual company meeting and awards dinner. After three hours of the requisite schmoozing, I raced out to Chagrin for what was left of my Act One blocking rehearsal. I got home around 10:45 and crashed into bed. After a nice 8 hour slumber, I started all over again today....meetings, rehearsals and (as of yet) no yummy glazed doughnuts.
