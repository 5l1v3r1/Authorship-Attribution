Things seem weirdly different to me right now. Not in a bad way...just  different.  Perhaps it's the fact that I am finished with my insane rehearsal and performance schedule. Maybe it has to do with the busy season setting in full swing at work...effectively numbing me from my own boredom. I sat at my office today quickly ticking off the things on my list...feeling efficient and productive, but I was also thrilled to not have to bolt off somewhere else at 6pm. I could concentrate on my work and not worry about discharging myself at the prescribed time. Whatever it is, it's a welcome change. I am enjoying having my time back under my control. I told you a few weeks ago that I was working toward regaining control of my schedule. It's been like containing a wildfire, but slowly, my time is again my own. So, that's all fantastic, right? Well, what about the humorous and inevitable battle with boredom? Learning to slow down becomes the challenge...not meeting each impulse to busy myself. My life has been busy, cleverly tying moment to moment with various events and people, but there was always a through-line, something else to move onto...and that's not been the best way. Sometimes, you have to get off of the train. Sometimes, you have to walk to your next destination. Sometimes, you have to let life happen to you. You have to let people happen to you. Sometimes, you have to stay where you are and let the world go on spinning around you. Kinda scary. Kinda necessary.
