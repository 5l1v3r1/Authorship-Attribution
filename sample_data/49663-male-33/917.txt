Out of the woods...   I wish I was hiking the Appalachian Trail   Do you know what it's like to be in the deep woods where the foilage is so dense, it seems like dusk at midday?  Notes from a summer hike (with Kelly T):  My hike today was through very rugged, very deep woods terrain. The 90-degree heat was tempered a little by the dense vegetation, but the humidity was stifling. We hiked through steep ravines and forded over 8 or 9 streams. The water levels are low due to the summer-long draught we've been experiencing. I was reminded of my days at Camp Lejnar every summer from 2nd grade thru 7th. I was an expert in orienteering...which is to say...getting myself back outta the woods with no more than a compass and a canteen. Imagine being 8 years old & dropped in the middle of the woods and being expected to find your way back to camp. I loved the thought of it...and I won first prize every time. Something about trusting my intuition at a very early age.   Anyhow, hiking the Buckeye Trail today reminded me of trusting myself, following my own path and arriving at my desination with little more than the shirt on my back. It reassured me that I know how to find my path, and that I am not afraid to walk it...alone or with friends...we always get to where we're going.
