So, yeah.    In order to not freak myself out any more than I already have, I've reduced moving to these seven easy steps:    1. Throw crap out.  2. Sell house.  3. Buy new house.  4. Pack stuff up.  5. Have movers move stuff from old house to new house.  6. Unpack stuff at new place  7. Start new job.    Simple enough, right?
