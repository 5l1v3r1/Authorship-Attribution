Here it is, Monday morning again. The people on the West 52nd to West 57th blocks did not sleep well last night...there was a massive housefire that sent several people to the hospital and torched a good part of a house. The ambulances, firetrucks and other assorted rescue vehicles numbered well into the teens. The constant sirens and high-speed racing down the street was enough to bring most of us outside in our pajamas and/or other sleep attire. Then, when all of that settled down, the construction crew of the new housing project on the OTHER side of my house got busy....cutting cement. Needless to say, it was an incredibly LOUD morning. I'm thrilled that I'm not cranky.
