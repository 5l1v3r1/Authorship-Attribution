Howdy!  I was trying to explain websites and blogging to my 95 year old grandmother last evening.  Her head exploded . She kept saying, "Why would anyone want to do that?!" and "What do you get out of it?!" Nothing like being put on the defensive by granny. The notion is so inconceivable to her that she just had to plain give up on thinking about it. I suppose, though, she'd be able to better grasp the concept if she would actually get  on  the internet at some point. Trying to explain data suspended in the ether is very difficult...and nearly impossible to understand. Anyway...I'll keep working on her.
