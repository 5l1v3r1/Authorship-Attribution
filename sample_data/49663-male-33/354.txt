Last evening, I came home to a very excited Kelly, who informed me that she got her LSAT results in, and it was exactly the score she wanted and needed to get into the Law School of her choice.  We celebrated her good news with Kathy and Beth at Snickers for dinner and drinks. Then, we all went back to the studio to play music and be silly. We had Kelly listen to some of the new stuff Doug and I have been working on. We got home around 2AM. I didn't get up until 12:42 this afternoon!
