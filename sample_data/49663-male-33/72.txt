Saturday in the fall. It is as it should be: beautiful, crisp and a tad chilly...just like yesterday. I was thinking about taking Toby for a walk down by the lake this afternoon. The waves are surely crashing over the breakwall. Other than doing some general organizing around the house, I have only one real scheduled event, and that's dinner tonight at Phil's house. It should be an intimate gathering: Phil, myself, Jim, Carrie and Marianne.
