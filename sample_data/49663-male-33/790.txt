extraordinary, really...  I spent a few precious hours with my best friend from high school. Jennie was my constant companion for the better part of four years, excluding summers, when I had declared that we were only school year friends. I was weird...well, weirder back then. Jennie has lived in the UK for about eight years now, and I get to see her infrequently. Today, we roamed through the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum here in Cleveland. It's gotten a lot better since I first toured it several years ago. It was significant to me because Jennie and I spent a lot of time working in the radio business during high school, and a lot of our personal history now adorns the walls of the Rock Hall. Spending the time together was like peeling back an onion, until we stood there like we were somehow sixteen. Jennie's completely unique and intriguing effect on me is almost indescribable...you'd have to experience it to know what I'm talking about...but we envelop each other so completely, it's as if there was no one else on the planet. She's going to travel a bit here in the States and then end up back here in late December. We have a date to spend more time when she's back.  I can't wait!
