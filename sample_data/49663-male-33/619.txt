my big gay life (52)   Round-up! Everybody, circle your wagons! There was much drinking and debauchery this weekend. Between Rachel's birthday & my cousin being in town from Toronto...it's amazing my liver is functioning at all. There was drinking at Rachel's and at the Leather Stallion. There were even body shots, but I'm not saying who took off his shirt and lay down on the bar. On Sunday, there was the mandatory family gathering...lots of food and conversation before sending the Canadian family member home. Then, I went to perform a quick set from  The Sissy Show  at Cabaret Q...the variety show finale to the wonderful week known as  urlLink Out In Akron . By comparison, today's been a bit of a let-down. However, I celebrated my 5 year anniversary at work...so that's at least something. Right now, my nose should be deep in a book I'm reviewing for the Ohioana Journal...but I'm working on developing my procrastination skills. Yeah, like I need to work harder on that.
