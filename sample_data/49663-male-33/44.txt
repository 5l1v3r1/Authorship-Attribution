I received a very sweet email from Matt this morning. He's in New York and loving it. He says we should visit there together sometime. He called me at my parents' to say hello. He loves it so much there he's seriously thinking of tranferring to Columbia. Go for it, is what I said. God knows, there's nothing worse than feeling stuck in a place you don't like very much. I know he'd rather be in a major metropolitan area than in Cleveland. So, I guess we'll see what happens.
