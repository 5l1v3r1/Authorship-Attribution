The weekend was a welcome reprieve from the work week, but Sunday morning threw me a small curve ball: my house had sprung a leak...and it was causing one particular electrical outlet to sizzle and spark. So, after cutting that circuit breaker, we investigated the outlet and decided to call the insurance company. This is, after all, why we pay for insurance. So, the claims guy comes today to survey the leak damage and determine the next steps. It's always something, huh?
