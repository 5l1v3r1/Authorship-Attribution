These have been some of the most interesting and insightful days in recent memory. God knows I have been thru many, many weeks of pre-production and rehearsals for shows, but they were never shows I was producing, or personally responsible for, financially. I received an amazing education, and I am pleased to say that the investment of time, money and other resources seems to have paid off both figuratively and literally. I am so proud of the show, and my dear friends Greta, Chuck, Mike, Eric and Andrew deserve every accolade, every laugh and every ovation. THey are terrific and I am lucky to be along for the ride. What's more, the really wonderul people of Cleveland (other than the crotchety old critics) seem to have embraced the show, and are voting with their time and with their dollars. Many thanks to everyone who helped promote the show. We've got six performances left, and more if you want 'em!    Grandma is having an incredible few days in hospice. She is comfortable and serene, and pain-free. While it is heartbreaking to witness her final days, there is a sense of joy knowing we have had every opportunity to say what we needed to say, and to hear what we needed to hear. My grandmother and I are particularly close, more so than most, I think. She helped raise me, from just a few weeks old until I was 13, she lived in our house and was a part of my daily life. I know we are in her final days, and the call could come at any moment. Until then, I spend every available minute with her, enjoying her, and celebrating her astounding 96 years.    Does it seem a bit overwhelming? Absolutely. Am I surviving? Yes. Thank you for keeping our family in your thoughts and prayers. I'll speak to you soon, friend.
