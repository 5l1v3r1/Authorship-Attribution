crossing the divide   The memorial service for Grandma Stuart was this past Saturday at St. Andrews, a lovely rural church nestled somewhere between Kirtland and Mentor. It was the scene of our first ever family reunion in over two decades. I am overwhelmed by the time I spent with my family, people I knew, but seem to have only just met. I have a better understanding of myself and of my place in the world because of it. I can't relay how absolutely extraordinary it was to be with them. We are learning. We are familiarizing. We are laughing and crying. Together. Huge family rifts don't mend overnight, but we've made gigantic steps forward. The service was beautiful and heartfelt. Afterwards, we took a family portrait, the only one in existence...made more meaningful by the fact that all surviving family members were present. Then, my Uncle John decided to invite everyone over to his house on Sunday, so we could spend more time together. Remarkable...people really were wading into the river. I know all of my cousins and I felt absolutely high after spending time together, and vowed to keep it together this time around. In between the laughter and games and remembering, there were tiny green chutes...evidence of the thaw...and the promise of spring.
