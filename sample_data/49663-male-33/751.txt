It's weird when you have a little distance from things. Perspective shifts and you feel a little more grounded, perhaps. It seems like more and more time is programmed, which is no one else's fault but my own. I am looking forward to a much needed trip to a cabin in the Canadian wilderness...on Fawn Island. Toby and I wil head up there on Friday to spend time with college friends this weekend. I can think of nothing better...a little rest, relaxation and reflection...
