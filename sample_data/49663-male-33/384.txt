So, I have to go to the theatre soon. Well, the other theatre where I'll be singing tonight. I've noticed an appalling lack of gay men in the theatre of late, and I've wondered why. Maybe it's just regional? Anyway, in the past 3 or 4 shows I've done, it's been me and maybe one other person. Not the way it used to be. In the olden days, I would do shows  swarming  with gay folk. Just a weird curiosity I've noticed...no big whoop...
