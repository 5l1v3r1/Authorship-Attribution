Woohoo! We've surpassed our goal, folks! The Blogger Server Fund (PayPal + CafePress + checks) is now at an astonishing $10,622.71. This is more than we ever imagined this effort would result in. I think it's safe to say we have the finest group of users on the web. Thank you, thank you, thank you! We ordered two more servers last night, and we're still working on fully integrating the other one. So, while things have improved vastly already (and you can thank pb for the code optimizations), they're hopefully going to get better still. Plus, we're going to try to add some exciting new features to the site, and we'll be able to handle the rapid growth that helps us succeed for some time to come. For those who have written that they haven't had a chance to contribute yet, but want to, feel free. We'll keep the fund open. (We can always spend more money on servers. And every penny we do makes Blogger better.) But don't feel you have to. Thanks, again. (BTW, we'll start sending stickers as soon as possible. However, since more people contributed than we ever imagined, we're going to have to order more before we can get them out to everybody. Thank you for your [continued!] patience.)
