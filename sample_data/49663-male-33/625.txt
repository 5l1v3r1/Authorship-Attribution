Tonight's the opening for the national tour of The Music Man, and the official start of the season here. Sorry I've been so quiet lately...it's just been crazy behind the scenes. I also have the cast party tonight at STAR, the new restaurant here in the Center...so today will just be a 16-hour day. No biggie.
