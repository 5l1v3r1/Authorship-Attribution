okay, update on the song thingy...Doug says that this firm sells songs to various producers and labels...they get about 4 million inquiries a year, and have about 72 songs currently collecting royalties. So, it's kinda like having an agent. They have the material...they try to land it on an album...we all try to make money. Just to have made it to this point is mind-boggling. More updates as they are available...
