Ahhh, the end of summer in the city. All of the kids are back in school, and there seems to be a new sense of routine and orderliness.  It's like everything received a fresh coat of paint, and that "new car smell" still lingers. I look at school buses and laugh - I remember feeling stuck, like I'd never get out of there. Forever indentured to the Kenston Local Schools. The greatest day, perhaps, was the moment after my high school graduation, when all strings were officially severed. No one could hold anything over me anymore - especially delicious was the fact that no one ever caught me when I forged a report card in 7th grade. To this day, my forged grades stand on my record. I never told anyone about it until I had my degree from the University. THEN I told my parents (who thought the whole thing was a riot). Anyway, I kind of like that orderliness has returned to my rambunctious neighborhood. Things quiet down now around 9 or 10 in the evening, as opposed to 2 or 3. Plus, I like that first beautiful week when everyone has clean, new shoes.
