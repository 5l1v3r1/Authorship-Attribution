work swampy   I need help getting myself organized at work. I am so swamped, it's crazy! How are you supposed to deal with an average of 100 to 150 legit emails a day, phone calls, meetings, etc.? Where are you supposed to squeeze in the actual work part? I'm starting to think that the benefits of email are directly linked to the drawbacks. We seem to have higher capacity, but at what expense? I hate walking around feeling like every time I open my email box, I'll be buried in an avalanche.  So, today I will focus on work related to three main projects: 1.  urlLink THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE  2.  urlLink CHICAGO  3.  urlLink BROADWAY SEASON CAMPAIGN, Flight 2   If anything arrives in my inbox not related to those three items, will be reprioritized as "later." Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with work swampage?
