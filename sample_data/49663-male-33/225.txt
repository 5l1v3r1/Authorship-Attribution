Friday's opening went extremely well, even though the audience seemed dead. Yesterday, I visited with Doug and we worked on a few songs. I helped re-write one of his called "I'll Never Leave You" which I morphed into "Don't Want You (To Love Me This Way)" Last night's show was sold-out to a very enthusiastic crowd. I went to church this AM, and then attended the annual Christmas DInner...you can never get enough turkey dinner between Thanksgiving and New Years. Going to hang out with neighbor Dave until I have to go to Margaret's concert tonight at 8pm in Oberlin. Bye for now...
