birthday weekend recap    Trish came into town last Friday at about 5pm. We headed over to Doug's for the quick drive to Akron. Doug, Joni and I were doing an acoustic gig at Angel Falls. I had started to lose my voice and was not able to really sing out, Louise, so I sang what I could and acted as emcee. On Saturday, we spent time prepping for my birthday party at Phil's. The party itself was a huge success and was the best way to ring-in my new decade. Sunday was spent with my family out in Aurora...we grilled out, had birthday cake and enjoyed ourselves. In the evening, Trish and I made a brief appearance at DVDave's for D.A.S. (Danny Appreciation Society - stems from Real World New Orleans....now the official group name for any tv/movie event we do together). In the early morning, I took Trish to the airport, finished up a few errands and then returned to the airport for my flight to LaGuardia.
