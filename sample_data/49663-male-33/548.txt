Celebrity Sighting!    I thought you might appreciate this update. So, Miss Kelly and I went out for a nice leisurely lunch at the Diner on Clifton at around 1pm this afternoon. I had this weird gut-level feeling that I was going to run into Dan. I wasn't disappointed. A few minutes after ordering, the star of   urlLink unravel in 58  , entered the restaurant with a friend. I waved and said hello as he walked by our 2-top, only to return when  the only empty table is the one right next to Kel and me. I think it made him way more uncomfortable than it did me. Keep in mind, we haven't seen each other in 4 months...so this was our first encounter. He looks tan and healthy and no worse for the wear...I'm sure he's been out doing a lot of boating and skiing...but he also seems to have had a torrid love-affair with food since our break-up. Upon leaving the restaurant, I waved to say goodbye...he didn't look at me. I waved again...no dice. Just because I said I didn't want to talk to him doesn't mean we can't greet each other in public. Ah well...I did my part. In the end, a lot less stressful and uneasy than I imagined our first meeting would be.
