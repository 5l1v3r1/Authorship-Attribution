le bodegay   Le Bodegay is the name of St. Maarten's one and only gay bar (at least, when I was there). I loved the sign because even it was sorta in the closet. It read: Le Bodega   y. In any case, since my work cubicle is sounding more and more like a gay bar, what with all these diva remixes pumping nonstop (thanks to Mixmaster Brian Sayre), I figured I may as well start charging a cover. I don't have a kick-ass light show yet, so for now, I'll flick the fluorescent lights on and off to the beat...I may even invite DJ Moby or DJ Skribble to sit at my credenza and pump out tunes, MTV-style, yo! I'm not sure how my superiors here will take to my scheme, nor am I certain that I will be able to obtain the necessary liquor license. Well, whatever...the point is: if you stop by and hear the thump-thump thumpin, I wanna see some dancing...that's right...go on and bust a move!
