Went to lunch with the crew from work today...we celebrated Heather Marshall's 27th at the  urlLink Great Lakes Brewing Company . It's a brewery/restaurant that's been in my neighborhood for decades. My costume from  Into The Woods  arrived from Broadway this morning, so I am all set for tonight's show. Need caffeine.
