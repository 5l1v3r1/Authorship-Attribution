urlLink  .      For those of us who live here, and for those of us who were raised in this great city...the time is now to take action! We have lived with our pervasive and stifling citywide low self-esteem for too long. The time is now to wrench away the slow, plodding, backwards conservatism that is clotting the arteries of this city's cultural and economic cardiovascular system. Are we a city of gray-haired ex-banking executives and sports team owners? Are we a city of doomsayers content to watch opportunity after opportunity slip away to other regions, states and countries?    Let me ask you this:  what have YOU done to help revitalize our home, our city, our Cleveland?  Unless you are proactively seeking solutions, you may as well be a part of the brain-drain. Go ahead and move somewhere else...the rest of us don't have the time or energy to combat your negativism and doubt. Those of us who believe we can move this city forward must focus every bit of energy toward that goal. In the coming weeks and months, we must seize every opportunity to support Cleveland...in every decision large and small. We must keep industry, culture and housing both viable and attractive options. We have an overwhelming wealth of underutilized talent and capacity. We must keep work in our city. We must develop and create and support. We must be heard. Write something. Say something. But more than that,  do something .
