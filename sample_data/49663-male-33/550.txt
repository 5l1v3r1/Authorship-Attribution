I forgot to tell you...this morning as I was getting ready to take a shower, I look out the window from the master bath, and I see this large brownish-gray pig wandering through my neighbor's yard. It looks like it was domesticated...happily snuffling through the grass...pigtail wagging cheerfully. I had never seen it before, and stood there in disbelief. Who keeps a pig in the city?  And no one keeps a cow for a friend...sometimes I fear you're touched...
