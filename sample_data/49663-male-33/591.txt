Went out last night after work with a few friends from work. Suffice it to say, there was much beer and revelry. We headed over to the Hanna Theatre as TnT was letting out, picked-up our friend Bradley and headed over to Becky's for another drink. Then, we decided to tag along and hang out with the TnT cast on their weekly bowling night at Cloverleaf Lanes. Thinking we should mount a Playhouse Square team and challenge them to a bowl-off.
