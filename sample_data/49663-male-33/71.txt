Trish suggested that maybe you all needed an update on the whole Mystery David situation. After the comedy of the situation wore off, I was faced with the reality of waiting an entire week to find the true identity of this man. SO this is where I am: not worried and not really waiting...just intrigued to find out who this guy is.  Now, if you really want my opinion...I think I'd rather jet over to the UK and ask Tom (from plasticbag.org) out on a proper date. I'd insert the link to his site, but right now I'm using my old (quite old, in fact) Mac Centris...which can't do much of anything. I'm surprised it even allows me to post this much.
