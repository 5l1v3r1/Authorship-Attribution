my big gay life (42)    razzle dazzle 'em   I started my somewhat dubious non-professional career in the theatre in the 2nd Grade when Mrs. Finnick pushed me out center-stage as a fuzzy pink bunny rabbit in some (now secularly inappropriate) Easter pageant. Thus began my love affair with the theatre, and pink fuzzy footie pajamas. In any case, tonight is the official Opening Night for Chicago. And, I must say, I am particularly proud of this show, this company and everyone involved. So, as we careen ever closer to 8:00 P.M. EDT, wish us the best...as we all attempt to break our legs.      give 'em to old razzle dazzle  razzle dazzle 'em  give 'em a show that's so splendiferous  row anfter row will grow vociferous...  give 'em the old flim-flam flummox  fool and fracture 'em  how can they hear the truth above the roar?  throw 'em a fake and a finagle  they'll never know  you're just a bagel  razzle dazzle 'em  and they'll beg you for more...
