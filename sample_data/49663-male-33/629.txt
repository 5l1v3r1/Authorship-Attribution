Ranger Doug     "This is Todd"     "Hi, uh, this is Doug. The front desk transferred me."     "Pamela's good that way," I said.     "We met the other night on the Harvest Moon Hike. I work for the National Park Service."     "Oh right! You were videotaping the Ranger guy."     "Yeah, that's me. Listen, I hope you don't mind me calling. I saw the Playhouse Square logo on your shirt and thought you might work there...so that's how I found you. I'm really not a stalker."     "I'm impressed! Good deductive skills!"     "I really enjoyed talking to you the other night and wanted to know if we could get together sometime...maybe go for coffee or a hike. Dinner maybe?"     "I had a great time, too! I'd love to grab dinner, coffee or a hike sometime. Definitely."     "Great! (pause) Wow. I was nervous."
