My schedule this week would have been enough to kill a lesser man. Between work and final rehearsals, I'm getting about 6 hours of sleep a night (not enough for me) and I'm just exhausted. Last night was talent meltdown night at the theatre. Several of us just blew chunks in the performance dept. Yuck! I'd have fired me. Brain farts and mind-snaps all around. Whew! Glad that one's over!!
