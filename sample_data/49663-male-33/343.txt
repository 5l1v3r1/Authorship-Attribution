So, I went to this rehearsal tonight for a special anniversary show being put on by Brecksville Little Theatre in April-May. On one hand, it's great being reunited with a couple people I've done shows with before. Almost the entire original cast of  Jacques Brel  is participating, but we're only doing 2.5 songs from it. On the other hand, the rest of the people are of questionable to moderate talent. If I ponder it too long, I start to worry. One other nice thing: I get to sing "Hello, Little Girl" from  Into The Woods .
