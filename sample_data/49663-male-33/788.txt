missing you, poodle.    Dear Poodle,   I received your xmas update letter today and loved reading all about your travels and such! Life here at good old PSC about the same since we last spoke: busy, crazy and insane. These are three qualities everyone should look for in a workplace.     My dog, Toby, continues to be cute and has honed his skills in the flirtation department, often scoring me loads of phone numbers from both men and women. I love that dog.     I was excited to hear about your trip to Europe and would love to know more if you ever have the time to chat. I've always wanted to go backpacking there!      RIVERDANCE THE SHOW had a very good week here at the State Theatre in November, although, I must confess, it looks very different from the original...and I feel it lost it's electricity.  This is most likely due to the fact that you weren't there...but that's just my humble opinion.     Working on STONES IN HIS POCKETS at the moment and planning my next great adventure (I'm writing, writing, writing for the project development team at HBO). Keep your fingers crossed!     When you have a moment to catch your breath and get caught-up being off tour, give me a jingle and we'll chatter. All my best!    Love,  Todd
