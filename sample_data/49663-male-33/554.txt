Tonight's my last night out here at  Rusty Ranch . This weekend is my last for  Chicago . Lotsa stuff finishing, ending. I guess it makes way for the new...and, Oh, I am ready! I spent the better part of the evening catching-up with an old friend. We have a tradition of celebrating our birthdays and Christmas in the summer...so tonight was the night! I got this great book of black & white photos called  Backstage . It features really great candid backstage photos from a handful of Broadway shows. I also received a serenity fountain for my house...very cool...I'll just have to figure out where to put it. Kevin called me and told me I had 4 loge tix to the Sade concert Saturday, too bad I'll be doing my own show. Sigh. She's my absolute favorite!!
