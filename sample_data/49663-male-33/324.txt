Last night was incredible...just perfect. Low-key, relaxing and wonderful. We had dinner at a Chinese/Vietnamese place which was lighted harshly by fluorescent lighting. The food, however, was amazing. After dinner, we went back to his house to watch television or play cards...but we never quite got that far. Instead, we just curled-up on the couch and watched the snow fall (we've been getting lots of that, lately).
