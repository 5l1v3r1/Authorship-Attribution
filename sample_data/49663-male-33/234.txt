I left early Thursday morning to catch my flight to Baltimore, where I would rendezvous with Trish and her friends Ralph & Lori. My flight arrived on time & I chatted with my mother via cell phone while I waited for my ride. When they arrived, I hopped in and we set off for Williamsburg. I really had no idea what to expect. We spent five days exploring, eating, sightseeing, eating, shopping and eating our way through the town. Amazing! I would totally recommend it to anyone interested in history (or eating)!
