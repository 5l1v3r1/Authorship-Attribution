my big gay life [24]   Suddenly, I am gaining market value. It's a great thing for the bruised ego, really. I am bewildered at the sheer number of times I have been asked-out this week. What's going on in the cosmos? It's not that I even have interest in most of them, I just found it, well, odd. Don't get me wrong, it's fabulously flattering...but after the 4th person called me up and asked me out, I started laughing (not AT him, mind you). Anyway, when it rains, it pours. I'll keep you updated...
