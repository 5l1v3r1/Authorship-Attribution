god, lots of stuff going on! I've been spending a lot of time talking to my mother who is dealing with the failing health of her best friend. Not easy stuff for a woman who has the health of her own mother and sister to keep her occupied. Grandma is 94 and still living independently...my Aunt has Parkinson's...so sometimes Mom feels, well...a lot of things. It gets to be a bit much at times. But, for today, she's in a good space...and for that, I am thankful. Still working on reviewing that book...I feel like I'm in college again and I've got a looming assignment. Better get to it...
