I just returned from the movies! The beautiful old Vaudeville-era theaters in which I work, host a wonderful  urlLink classic cinema series . Imagine a beautiful '20s movie palace...old organ playing before the feature...a newsreel and a few cartoons. Tonight's feature was   urlLink Rebel Without A Cause   starring the dreamy James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo (as opposed to the other Rebel Without A Cause starring Hal Slabotnick and Joyce Lawnweasel, right?). Anyway, had a terrific evening, even though I'm barely awake. Managed to pick up my Jetta from the dealer...she was in for an oil change and a new brake light.
