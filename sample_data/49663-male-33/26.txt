I just received a promotional CD from RCA Victor which has two songs on it...Christina Aguilera's  Come On Over , and Christina Aguilera's  Ven Conmigo ...as if the English version wasn't irritating enough. Still, it's quite amusing because it's an enhanced CD which contains the full-length music video for said song. You can play/pause whenever...and I'm thinking of doing some fun digital reconstruction.
