So, I hit the trails again yesterday. I decided I was long overdue for a hike in the woods. This time, however, I was not alone. Toby (my 13 year old, 8 pound Papillon) decided he needed to go with me. I couldn't avoid the pleading looks he was shooting me as I gathered my hiking gear. I finally crumbled and brought him along for the short 5 mile hike in the Brecksville Reservation of the Metroparks. He was an amazing little trooper! He dropped into a very Zen-like place and kept pace with me the entire time. Mind you, there was a light, but steady, drizzle the entire hike. By the end, we were both drenched down to the bone and he looked really silly. You've heard the term "drowned rat," right? Toby looked like a wet guinea pig. Poor thing. The amazing thing was the incredible beauty of the woods on a wet Autumn day. We saw three deer...one was a multi-point buck we startled deep in the more wooded section of our hike. He was majestic and gorgeous and perfect. It was one of those moments you can never really describe. It was amazing to hit the trails...because it's less about the hiking and more about the things you figure out along the way. That's the true beauty of it...
