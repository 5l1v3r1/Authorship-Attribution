Things I like (in no particular order): Rabbits, papillons, Trish, curry, Jim B., David from last week, Joey (of course), low-humidity, Volkswagens, ice cream, sprinkles, mashed potatoes, single malts, single men, a good red wine (not that Zinfandel crap, either), SoulDecision - that hunky boyband, my grandmother who is 93, Jennie Wise, my nephew Zach.
