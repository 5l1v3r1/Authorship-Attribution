I am finally back from sunny and FABULOUS Ft. Lauderdale. Imagine: 85 degrees, sun, beaches...scantily-clad men and women bobbling around the beaches as far as the eye could see....and me in a meeting room with no windows. How's that for sucky? However, I managed to achieve a nice red sunburn as my only souvenir of my 54 hour trip. I will update you all later. In the meanwhile...kisses for all...
