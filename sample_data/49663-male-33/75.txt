I think I need a major holiday...like one that would take me to another continent. Maybe I should go visit my friend Belisha in the UK, or Pelayo in Spain. Regardless, leaving the good old US of A sounds pretty good. One problem, though...I need to renew my passport.  It expired a year or so ago...and the picture is HORRIBLE!!!
