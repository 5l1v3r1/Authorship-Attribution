urlLink Reasons Why       Where am I today? I wish that I knew  'Cause looking around there's no sign of you  I don't remember one jump or one leap  Just quiet steps away from your lead    I'm holding my heart out but clutching it, too  Feeling this sort of a love that we once knew  I'm calling this home when it's not even close  Playing the role with nerves left exposed   And standing on a darkened stage  Stumbling through the lines  Others have excuses  But I have my reasons why...   We get distracted by dreams of our own  But nobody's happy while feeling alone  And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall  We lean another ladder against the wrong wall   And climb high to the highest rung  To shake fists at the sky  While others have their excuses  I have my reasons why   With so much deception it's hard not to wander away  It's hard not to wander away, it's hard not to wander away...
