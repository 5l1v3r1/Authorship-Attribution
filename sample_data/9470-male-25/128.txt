I'm considering a change of name...  Not my name.. the name of this blog...   Why?  It's a long story...  It goes back to my training as a marketeer... The Name "A Blog Formerly Known as My Ramblings and Rants" is far too long and from a branding perspectiv too complicated for anyone to refer. Not that anyone is refering to me... But, if someone were to refer to me, then that would be a real problem... A Branding nightmare... In fact I can hardly think of any popular blog which has such a long name.   So one needs a snappy one or two words for the blog...
