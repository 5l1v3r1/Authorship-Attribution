My company has declared a 5 day week from today. So now I get two days to kill on on the weekend... hmmm. I think I should plan to buy the DVD player as soon as possible. I have one on my laptop, but the screen size is no fun.  I'll maybe pick up a cheap sony two speaker DVD/Tuner combo. but Sony stuff in India is damned expensive...
