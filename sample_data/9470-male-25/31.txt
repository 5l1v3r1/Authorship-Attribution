another day begins, wonder what this has in store. I downloaded the new  urlLink Internet Explorer  Beta here, with smart tags et al. Must say the Outlook splash screen looks mind blowing. It seems to be more stable than the earlier preview release. The smart tags are neat, but I wonder as to how useful they might prove in the course of ordinary browsing??
