Decided to go  urlLink ego surfing  today. The term Chirag  urlLink throws back  this blog as the number 5 result. Not bad considering a  urlLink few months ago  I wouldn't even feature in the top ten.  A search for  urlLink Chirag Patnaik  now throws back this blog as the first one... Earlier it used to throw back one of the sites I'd done.  I also decided to have a look at who was  urlLink linking  to me... Pitifully few of course. And all of them from Comments I made somewhere or as part of some blog directory. I found    urlLink Recently Updated Indian Weblogs   He lists my Blog as...  urlLink Chirag   This is of course because of the long and unwieldy name of my blog. I'd realised this  urlLink earlier  of course. This just proves that I have to rebrand the blog.       urlLink Link
