This is the first major censorship attempt by the Govenment of India.   My alumni group runs on yahoogroups... I'm really really pissed. Apart from  urlLink anonymizer.com , there is  urlLink Guardster.com ,  urlLink the-cloak.com  and the dmoz/google  urlLink directory  of free anonymising proxies...  this is al very fine.. but I can't login to see the mesages on the group... The Cloak is supposed to allow it, but it doesn't seem to work... suggestions welcome
