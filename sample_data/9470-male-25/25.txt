My posts are going to be more and more erratic till I get back from Calcutta and Bhubaneswar grand tour, from my interview and holiday, so please bear with me. You'll also note the change in writing style, which has now become staid and stilted, I dunno what's come over me and all that, perhaps the tension of the upcoming results and interview.
