It's been a week since I started driving a bike again... I don't think I can get the bike to scream down the streets of Delhi at 100+ Kph for a few months to come :(  The Bike is now blue (Pics tomorrow), it was black before.   Black is not lucky (auspicious?) for me (or so an astrologer told my parents)
