I decided to add a few blogs on my page, then I realised that my blog would come (if at all) on other peoples blogs way down in the bottom, so I've decided to change the name of my blog to  A Blog Formerly Known As My Ramblings and Rants . hahahah I'm  Invincible . I may not be original, but I'm invincible.   urlLink Tracy  dropped a line saying I'm a lazy bum (not quite) haha. she actually asked which blogs were abusive. I say all of them heeheehee.
