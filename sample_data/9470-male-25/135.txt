Last night I started reading  urlLink For God, Country, and Coca-Cola  by Mark Pendergrast...   It traces the history of Coca-Cola from the early days of being a patent (quack) medicine as a rip off by pemberton, of something that was then sold as Vin Marini... the buying out my Asa candler, the early blanket marketing by Robinson... The rumours of Cocaine content, and the subsequent removal fo Cocaine from the formula. Earlly advertising, the journey from being a medicine, to a Cocaine laced soft drink to a Simply refreshing Cold Drink. The book reads like a thriller. I've reached a point where Robert Woodruff has just taken over the company...
