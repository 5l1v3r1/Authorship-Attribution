Todays town is Nasirabad. this town is in the Western state of Rajasthan, this place is extremely hot in the summers and has a perenial water shortage. Nearby places of interest include Ajmer which has the Dargah(shrine) of someone famous (forgot who it was). it is rumoured the emperor Akbar himself had come here and had had his prayers fulfilled. I did class 2 and 3 here, in Battle Axe Montessori and the St. Anslem's School. Last words Okay place, absolutely no crime and I don't wanna go there again, ever..
