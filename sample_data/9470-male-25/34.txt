BTW, Martin Sorrell bought over a sister (our host) agency Bates. Which means our host will probably cease to exist ina  few months time... which makes me wonder as to what happens to my agency? 25% of which is now owned by WPP, and the rest is owned by WPP's arch (and bigger) rival Publicis... the word that comes to mind is B...... :|  that the agency parentages are somewhat complicated is an understatement...
