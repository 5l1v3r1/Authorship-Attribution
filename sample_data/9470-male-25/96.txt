This edition still in Beta, presents the daily paper online, not in classic internet format, but regular broadsheet format. With one being able to click and read the section one desires. This is similar to the Orange Country Register Digitl version.  Though one is not privy to the software being used, but the underlying technology, navigation and presentation clearly points to Olive Software, which has also powered the Orange County Register digital edition.    urlLink http://digital.guardian.co.uk/        urlLink Link
