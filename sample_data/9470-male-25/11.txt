By the way, when prez Clinton left India for Pakistan he had to use a decoy plane, The secret service feared the plane would be shot down by stinger missiles in Pakistan. Stinger missiles in Pakistan? well they were supplied with gay abandon to the Afgani's during the Afganistan war. and now are in the hands of the Pakistani terrorists.  The best part is yet to come. The CIA tried to buy back the Stingers, then they said they'd pay for photographs of the broken stingers. yes ppl it's all true, it's all happening here, the most happening place on this planet.  The  Nuclear flashpoint in this world.
