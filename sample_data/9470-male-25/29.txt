My favourite place of the lot is Pune. This maybe so because I did my graduation here and lived here foir two years in a hostel.I visit this place once in a couple of months, the fact that this place is only 4 hrs away also helps. A very very nice place to live in, I'd like to live here, if I I get a job or something like that. This place is a 4 hour train ride from Bombay, and a retirement city so to speak. though it is changing for the better now. It is more and more becoming a young persons city, somewhat like Bangalore.  God I love this city, wish I could stay here for ever.
