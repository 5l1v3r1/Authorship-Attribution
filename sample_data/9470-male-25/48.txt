Does advertising have variations across the year?   was a question asked.  Of course. and it varies differently for different categories. As a broad and general statement for print, advertising peaks in October, with an immediate fall in November. For the rest of the year it is more or less at a stable level, except for a slight dip in Feb, April and July.   Of course there is also the fact that there will be individual variations for different categories... woollens, cars, computers for obvious reasons.  Then there are special events like the world cup, which would bring about huge swells in spends. This last world cup showed a monitored swell of 50% on print... amazing is the only word I can think of
