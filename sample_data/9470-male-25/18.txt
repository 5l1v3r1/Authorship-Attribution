The first place I'm writing about is a place called Yol Camp, This town is based on a hillside in the Kangra district in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This place is near Dhramsala, which more famous due to the the Tibetan Government in exile. I've lived in this town twice, the first time when Iwas doing kindergarten, and then more recently in class 8th and 9th. I remember a few things from my first stay. I used to go to a school called the Sacred Heart School, which is about 8 KM away from Yol. And the other time I studied in Kendriya Vidalaya (Central School).   This place has a lot of temples around it. This place also served as a jump of point to visit other cities and towns in North India, like Pathankot, Jammu, Vaishno Devi(a very big pilgrimage spot). A very picturesque locale. As the whole town is based on the hillside, and the roads up the hill are inclined at a 70 degree angle, and is wont to happen, a lot of accidents take place.   Last words: A very Sleepy Town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home (let me otta here)
