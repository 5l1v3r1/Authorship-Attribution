There is some talk in the blogosphere on the death of email, saving email, rss replacing email, new email projects like  urlLink Internet Mail 2000 ... what I'm trying to do here is to piece together the various points of views and solutions..   The premise: E-mail is dying. Why? because of the amounts of spam flowing into peoples mail boxes and the attack of viruses like SoBig.    We will explore what Michael Fraase has to say  urlLink now  and  urlLink then . At some point one will begin to wonder whether RSS will  urlLink kill "email" or "email publishing" ... huge difference between the two. When one figures this out, one will realise that there are people on the other side of the debate too. i.e. feel email will  urlLink live  and of course someone  urlLink countered  this as well and a  urlLink response  to that and of course there will be people like  urlLink me  who will be bystanders attempting to make sense  urlLink in the chaos that exists
