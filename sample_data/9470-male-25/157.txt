Friends, Pakistanis and Wellwishers, lend me your ears. (actually eyeballs) :).  After weeks of what can only be termed as medieval torture i.e. pricks, boiling water, melted wax, electrocution, fingers bent thisway and that, I've recovered to a state which can be termed as normal as far as civilised humans go. I was finally able ride a bike (Yes the very same one, that was smashed in my unfortunate close acquaintance with a truck on the picturesque route to Mussorie) as of yesterday. It was limited to a an agonisingly short 10 minutes, but till more strength returns that will have to do. Physiotherapy will continue for the next few months, but if all goes well, I should be back in Delhi on the first of August and rejoin on the 2nd. Of course I have to hunt for a physiotherapist that suits my timings, but that is a small matter...  Before you say that should be the last joyride across the country, I'm thinking of driving back to Delhi on the bike... still have to convince a few people though... :)  Cheerio  Chirag
