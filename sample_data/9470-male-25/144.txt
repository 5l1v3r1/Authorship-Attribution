I'm going to be buying a digital camera soon... I've finally settled on the  urlLink Canon Powershot S1 IS . Mainly selected because of the huge Zoom (10X) and the image stabilisation system on the camera... Am Also buying a  urlLink Sandisk 256 Mb Compact flash Card .  and a couple of sets of  urlLink 2200 NiMH PowerEx batteries and a Maha Charger  to power the entire rig...
