Roland Piquepaille in  urlLink Can You Pay U.S. Programmers at Overseas Salaries?     While cMarket has solved its immediate challenge, the implications of Jon's approach are potentially mind-bending. What if other companies begin taking the same approach -- offering Indian-style wages to American workers? On the positive side, we could begin to solve our job-creation problems. But on the negative side, America's standard of living would inevitably decline. There's only one way to find out for sure how it all might shake out, and that is for other executives to replicate Jon's experiment. The results could be quite interesting.    What is irritating about this is that America waves the flag of globalisation and when globalisation hits it, it goes screaming like a baby...   This is similar to the Visa regimes instituted by the West post World War II, trying to stop the influx of immigrants to maintain a better standard of living. When people world over figured that manufacturring in poorer countries is cheaper and businesses started moving manufacturing... America started screaming like a baby again about labor standards et al.   Conclusion of this Rant: If you want globalisation, allow free flo of labour. oops, you can't do that... otherwise Indians will take over your tech jobs... :D       urlLink Link
