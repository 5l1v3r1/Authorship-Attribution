I thought this was a brilliant idea. Apparently the Google bar doesn't have the IE Control+Enter shortcut, and it trips up on urls like http://bloglines.com/myblogs, or part urls like download.com,  which are handled by the address bar.  So if someone at google fixes this, then one can be rid of the address bar and save some screen height in the Web Browser...
