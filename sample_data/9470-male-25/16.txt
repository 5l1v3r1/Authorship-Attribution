The next place I'm writing about is Wellington, no it is not the Wellington you're thinking of. This Wellington is in the Southern Indian state of Tamil nadu, My father was here for his Staff College Course at the Defence Services Staff College. This place too served as a jump of point visit several Southern Indian cities like Mysore, Chennai (Madras) and the like. The hill station Oooty is just a stones throw away from here. There are two ways to get to Wellington. One is to take a bus from the nearest Railhead Coimbatore, and the other is to take the toy train, just joking, it's actually a metre gauge train which has a third rail in between the two tracks to provide traction while climbing the steep hill sides. again a very Picturesque location. I did Class 1 and half of Class 2 here, we had stayed here for only 1 year. I studied in a school called the Holy Angels. The year of stay 1985.   Last words: A very sleepy town, absolutely no crime, ideal retirement home, I could live here, in 50 years time
