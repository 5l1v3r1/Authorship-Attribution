Now that the camera is out of the way, I was thinking of getting myself a new hard disk mp3 player. This is a dream device  iRiver PMP 120  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     Or this  iRiver H 320   urlLink     urlLink     They have the advantage of being able to interface with my camera and download pics directly. Can Play MP3 (duh!), Ogg, WMA, Show pictures stored and the first one also plays video.
