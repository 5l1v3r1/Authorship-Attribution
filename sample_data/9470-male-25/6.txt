I rated 75 out of 100 on the  urlLink suave-o-meter .  It says:  You are quite the Casanova! You know how to play the dating game, and you're damn good at it! Most likely, you are a woman magnet and you are never without an admirer. It appears that you have an incredible amount of charm, and your attentive and sensitive demeanor makes you irresistible. You have definitely been taught well. You know how to treat a woman, and you make sure that she feels special and appreciated by yours truly. You have a knack for expressing yourself and showing your interest, without looking too eager. That is a difficult balancing act, and you deserve a pat on the back for perfecting it. At the rate you're going, you won't be dating much longer before you score your dream girl!   I don't have a girlfriend, and with my looks never will too.
