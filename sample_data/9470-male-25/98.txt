Scoble Comments     Last night in the airport I was reading a copy of Fast Company magazine. It's really weird to see quotes from webloggers in the pages of magazines. Joi Ito had a quote featured there.   In Wired, the smiling faces of Ben and Mena Trott stared out of the pages at me.   It's a strange world we've all entered. Three years ago I barely knew what a blog was.
