All Media reporting seems to concentrating on the fact that a  single  yahoo group has been banned. but the fact of the matter is. It is the  entire Yahoo Groups sub-domain    urlLink groups.yahoo.com  that has been banned...   The ultimate irony is tht everyone know knows of this yahoo group... and atleast worldwide (if not india) people can read what the dissidents have to say... and this censorship has made them more famous, rather than consign them oblivion which was the intention...  The  urlLink IT ACT 2000  says it allos for  balanced flow of information ... which is bullshit. It is censorship plain and simple. What is most pissing is that hey don't even know how to do it properly.
