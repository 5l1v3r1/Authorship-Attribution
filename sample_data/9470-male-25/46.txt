Nice quote for the day...  "There's a warder who's fond of me. I don't ask why, I've learnt to take what's there without questioning the source. When he sees me on all fours scrabbling at the earth in a random-looking way that is quite scientific, he gets upset and hurries over with the spade and offers to help me. Especially, he wants me to use the spade. He doesn't understand I want the freedom to make my own mistakes."   ~from "The Passion", by Jeannette Winterson
