Talk about crazy inventions... Matsushita has developed an  urlLink Intelligent screwdriver . It can be pre-programmed. As one readerd somments on the quoted post. it is more a luxury item than a practical tool...  an even better quote...   My Sears el-cheapo 14V screwdriver is a fair bit damn more intelligent than that one, I'd bet...   ... It's powered by my finger, which has a pretty straight pipe to my brain.  Beat that, Matsushita.  :)         urlLink Link
