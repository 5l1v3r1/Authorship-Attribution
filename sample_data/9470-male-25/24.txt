My first post to my blog,  Those Paki's (Pakistanis)ought to be fried in hot oil, maybe even roasted in the warm glow of Nuclear radiation.   In brief the rant is as follows: Pakistan (a country with delusions of grandeur) claims that Kashmir is a part of their country, when actually it is part of mine. Their (The Pakis) country has been a breeding ground for terrorists like a piece of rotten wood is a breeding ground for Fungus. I believe that the Western media has still not emerged from their cold war mindset, is shown by the fact that whatever India does is a Human rights violation and whatever the terrorists do are legitimate acts towards freedom. Also seen in their attitude in Chechnya. When the Russians bombed that place to oblivion, it was a gross violation of Human rights, when Americans and the rest did the same in Yugoslavia it was a fight for the good of mankind (certainly not that of the Yugoslavians)  Do hungry people a favour click on this link  urlLink The Hunger Site     Have decided to implement a new navigation system for my website which is located at  urlLink http://india.4mg.com .
