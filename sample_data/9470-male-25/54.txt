For the people who are visiting this place and have no idea about what is a blog... here is a brief intro...  A Blog is short for WebLog. It is nothing but a personal online journal. In my case as the description on the side says, it is "The Ramblings and Rants of somebody in particular about everything in general..." :).  If you need pointers on how to get one for yourself, do drop  urlLink me  a mail...
