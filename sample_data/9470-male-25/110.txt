As a member of the Nokia planning team, I was party to the market Insight, that the device is becoming secondary to the whole process of communication... While this is worrying to Nokia Nokia is itself digging it's own grave...  How?   For years, Nokia phones were known for their simplicity and ease of use, and admittedly by the top execs of hte company that the proprietary interface on their hones had a lot to do with it... Howver the newer Nokias are using the Symbian Series 60 based OS. Which means that the interface is no longer the key distinguishing factor between the different brands of phones.  This coupled with the earlier insight would mean an ever weaking technological position which has been Nokia's marketing pitch in the past. The oft repeated statement in any marketing course as to Technology no longer being a differentiator, but a leveller, will be true for Nokia.   This  Wired  story on cracking of the Nokia N-Gage Games to be run on other Series 60 OS phones (Siemens), illustrates the point above.. It doesn't matter who you buy your phones from, modern applications will run on all of them
