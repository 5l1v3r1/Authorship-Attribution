What the...  urlLink You are Blogging my view...   The first time i heard the term Blogging, the first thing that came to mind was two men in Kerela on a Gogonet tree and one saying to the other, You are blogging my view. However, now this means something totally different to me. Blogging my view, now means that after reading your blog, my views are changing. How many of us are actually willing to let go of our opinions and accept new ones as we just read or heard something different from the views we so strongly believed in all this while. This is like writing a personal diary for everyone to read. I always thought about those who write a diary. I thought those were the people so desperate that someone  picks up their diary and reads it and saves them. It was a cry for help for those poor recluses and introverts. And then they made this rule, thou shall not read a personal diary. This obviously attracted more people to their diaries. So am i turning into a hopeless recluse?? I hope not. I do tend to drift away, but i think it gives you a chance to increase the scope of your discussion. Anyways...         urlLink Link
