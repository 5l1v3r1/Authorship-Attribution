Today's place is called Naugam, this place is so far from civilisation that the nearest School is 35 Kms away, cool eh? You might also be interested to know that this place lies in the Kashmir Valley is right on the LoC with Pakistan. So sensitive is this place that one is not allowed to use crackers for  Diwali . A nice place to visit for a while but horrible place to stay. a lot of picnic spots next to mountain streams and brooks, and also a lot of hiking trails, camping out is really fun here. There is no animal threat of anykind except for the occasional Leopard and the like.  Last Words: Nice place wish I could visit every Year, Unfortunately can't because of Pakistani Terrorists which makes this a non family station. Maybe in a century hence it'll be peaceful again, till then sigh
