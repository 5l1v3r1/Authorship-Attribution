Wired report , The Internet still functions after Saturday midnight -- so far. The Blaster worm failed to bring down a Microsoft's site and network, and cause other mischief as planned. Microsoft says 'no problem,' but warns individual computers remain vulnerable if not patched.   When my comp was having fits last monday I was wondering what the hell was happening...  It was this blaster worm of course, fortunately for me I had another OS installed, I got on to the web, downloaded the patch and was back up and running in no time flat :D.
