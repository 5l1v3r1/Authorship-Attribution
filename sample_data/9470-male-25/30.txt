From the West of the Country I went all the way to the North East. The next city I lived in was Guahati. This city is the largest in the entire North Eastern Part of India. It has a very famous temple called the Kamakhya which has been filthly maintained. Also famous in this region is the Assam Silk Saree, which was exported by my Mother to all her relatives all over the country and abroad. We went to several places in Assam and the neighbouring states. Some of the places we went to were Cherapunji(Highest Rainfall in the world). We also went to the Kaziranga National park, famous for the One Horned Rhino. Generally an okay city if you can put up with the people who cannot speak English or Hindi properly and not to mention the fact, that they invariably mispronounce your name. An interesting superstition is that  you cannot leave Assam unless you have crossed the Bramhaputra at least seven times. If you do leave before you have done so, you are destined to come back. I don't think I want to go back to this place again simply because there is nothing to go back to or for.
