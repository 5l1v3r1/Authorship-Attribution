urlLink exchange4media  reports that there might be a shift of ad revenues from TV to print due to CAS (Condional Access System)...  Nonsense.   I think (like the other Media Planners quoted in the story) nothing of the sort is going to happen. Silly to assume, that post CAS viewership and readership patterns will change... In fact if the promise of cheaper cable comes through. one might have more people opting for a cable connection.
