This was the whole point I was making, that technology is no longer something you can talk about when you are marketing a product when I posted  urlLink this    According to the Chinese Ministry of Information, world # 1 and #2 wireless handset makers are not doing that well in China. From January to September 2003, Chinese makers produced 129 million handsets.  Ningbo  held the top spot at 15%.  Motorola  slips to #2 at 14%, followed closely by   TCL   at 12%. Rounding out the top four,  Nokia  held a 10% share. Wanna bet that next year one of these two chinese handset makers will be selling phones in  US  for $50 a pop - and they will include camera, some bluetooth and good knows what.   [GigaOm]
