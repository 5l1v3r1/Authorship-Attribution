After two weeks of long days and nights I think I'lll be able to leave office at a decent time from tomorrow.  I was preparing a  media manual for Nokia... lots of time spent... I hope the effort was worth it... I guess I come to know when I present it to the client  But that is tomorrow, today I got to get back to work...
