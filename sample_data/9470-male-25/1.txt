Kota is the place of the day, this city has the unique distinction in India to be the host for different kinds of power plants namely, Thermal, Hydroelectric and Nuclear power plants. Your's truly has visited them all. This city is also in the western state of Rajasthan. It is very hot here in the Summer and almost nobody uses an Air Conditioner. This place afforded the only stability for any length of time. As I did my Class 10th 11th and 12th here. Had a generally fun time, as everybody does in the final years of school. We visited a lot of places in Rajasthan from here. Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Bharatpur(the bird sanctuary), Mathura and had almost decided to go to Delhi in the same trip but wiser counsel prevailed.   I will want to go to this place, just to revive the memories of the good old days of school and the like.
