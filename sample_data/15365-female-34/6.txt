Outside North Ridge Hospital, the one that I know all the shortcuts to, I sit waiting for Triple A after hand holding in room 426 this time.  My grandmother is in again for rehydration. This time it's been 8 days. Today was by far the hardest. I decided to reach across and hold her hand bruised, swollen, arthritis with gout, not really a hand anymore.  Years of sewing trusses, hunched over, and for low pay.  I suspect she won't be around much longer. I think she has decided to let go. After all, there is nothing left here for her but more pain and the missing husband of 53 years, now dead 13 months.  The past 6 have been reasonable considering her coherence is so limited but today she was there. I saw in her eyes the same Grandmother who played games with me all summer long, put on plays, treated me like sugar on top of strawberries and now, me, child of 30 at her bedside; shriveled old woman the years were not kind to, wanting death knowing too full well now in my reaching out was saying to her from all of us for the first time the last time, you are forgiven.
