Here is a little introduction to a few of them     Soya : Soya is a good source of protein and low fat. Can be used to produce milk, dairy replacements products, as well as to replace the texture and bulk of meat, usually in the form of textured vegetable protein. Is usually the basis for many meat substitutes.     Tofu  : Manufactured by a process similar to cheese making, but from soya milk. Very good source of protein, calcium and low fat.  Able to take on flavours well — great for marinating. Can be used for stir–fries, kebabs, salads and just about anything savoury. Tofu also is available in a silken form which is used for desserts, sauces or flans.     Quorn : Not made from soya but is a mycoprotein. Made from the fermentation of a fungus, mixed with egg white. Usually found as chunks, mince, fillets, burgers or sausages.
