urlLink Quit book - Staying a non-smoker checklist : Im a non-smoker now.   The worst is over.   I will find new ways to deal with stress and difficult emotions.   Ill remember The 4Ds:  Delay Deep breathe Drink water Do something else.   Ill find new ways to relax, such as massage, deep breathing, relaxing my mind and body, and changing my routine.   Ill prepare myself carefully before I return to risky places and events.   I will cope with unexpected difficulties by taking some time to think before I react, and reminding myself of other ways to cope.   Ill take action if weight gain is really a problem. Ill be kind to myself if I put on a kilo or two.
