urlLink ARIES LUNAR CYCLE  by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com  March 20 - April 18  In true Aries style, this is a highly active lunar month of bold energy wherein we move forward on our personal ideas and desires. The equinox occurs just hours before the New Moon. This emphasizes the cycle's underlying theme of  balance  and brings us into the First Quarter of the lunar year... a major turning point. Daylight savings time occurs on April 4th further underscoring the shift towards  more and more light .   Last month you grounded yourself by strengthening your spiritual connection, getting in touch with your dreams and reaching for a higher love. Remember to utilize the warrior energy of Aries in a most sacred way as you  take action to manifest those qualities and dreams .   A 3-week Mercury Retrograde period begins on April 6th bringing you an opportunity to take care of unfinished business as you prepare to move full tilt boogie in new directions. The combination of planetary energies reminds you to  temper your ideas with patience, persistence and prudence  as you pursue lasting goals and values. Don't energize negativity, but  hone your intent and harness your will  in the most positive ways as you blast off into the fresh start of a most promising spring.
