DISSEMINATING ARIES   Even though the night fades, I hold the connection like sunrise sings the moon to sleep and drives truth into hiding for memories of future hopes of meaning.  Nothing has come true yet but it doesn't matter.  As long as there is breath to explain the similarities of shadows passed in misdemeanors of youth's lost excuses for being someone.  Regulating behavior is completely within the rights of the individual or so the law states.  Guidelines are drawn out poster big and glossy or matte depending on the given day or what can be given.  The stand still between answers to questions posed or swords drawn for a fight to the death of the ego.  Not everyone was famous in their past lives and some of us even are supposed to be who we are exactly as we are right now regardless of who likes it, and those that do.  Those who will be with us always are no less worthy of lifting up into truths known by all to be remembered by some.  The burden of keeping silent is celebrated only at the first sign of sound.  And though there may be more than nothing to it, I am found here in your loss more than you were known to be like me, straightening my spine as rainbows climb my back.
