urlLink First Coast News | Woman Accused of Setting Fire in Riverside Home : This is Alan's house! I can't believe this happened to him but I am really glad he wasn't hurt and his poetry is safe. Nestor says he is still living there in the back still sans electric and phone despite the fact the front of the house is burned up. Where is he going to go? I really hope he wins the Amy Lowell.
