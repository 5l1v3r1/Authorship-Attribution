Today's Content   There are enough words in what we(I) didn't say today, to fill up the page and get a car wash for free.  I absorbed you like a sponge, a bystander, the auctioneer, going, going...  but what could I offer you  in return, my body of work a messy string of cables and wires connecting everybody but me;  my body of work, a folder of pictures, from when I still dreamed of silver towers, the turbo elevator, and  eating at the company cafeteria like it was some kind of privlege.   You have to believe in something.   I was traded like a basketball star. I was sold to the highest bidder. I was pimped out to hunchbacks lapping the keys and told to repeat myself again and again.  I have told nobody the entire story and only you would understand when I say  that at least alcohol  was more honest.
