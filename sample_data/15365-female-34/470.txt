What ever happened to Jubilados? I really wanted to work there someday.   urlLink Jubilados starting Permaculture Designed Community and Symposium in New Mexico : Jubilados is a Spanish word referring to those who, having shed their careers, are joyous. Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting that joyful way of being in the elder years.  Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to contemplative practice, service and ecology. Our educational program includes symposia, focus groups and study groups. As an extension of these educational efforts, a community based on the principles developed in the symposia is being planned. The community will be open to anyone with a contemplative spiritual practice. The community's physical structure will be organized according to the principles of Permaculture. Permaculture allows that in natural systems, there is no waste; all resources can create benefit.   At Jubilados, old age is seen not as an end point, but rather as a rededication to creative service as an expression of the spiritual connection. The community is in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The site provides a setting conducive to spiritual practice, and is close to medical, educational and recreational services. More important, the proximity affords the opportunity for meaningful service in many community settings. The Jubilados Community will create an integrated lifestyle, based on mutual support rather than dependence.  The physical plant will be constructed in traditional village design with clustered buildings, allowing for the greater part of the site to be dedicated to open space. Common areas will include a meditation hall, communal kitchen, dining facilities and administrative offices. There will also be a library, a theatre, a gym and studios. Residences will consist of eight bedroom / bathroom suites clustered around a common kitchen / living area. Jubilados will begin construction in a year and will be ready to receive occupants in 2002.
