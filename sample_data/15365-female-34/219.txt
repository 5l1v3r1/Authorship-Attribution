urlLink Homestar Runner  This animated cartoon series features Homestar Runner and pals Pom-Pom, Marzipan, and, of course, the villainous Strong Bad, all looking like computerized Color Forms - mostly angles and circles. The story lines and songs are simple and goofy, with an addictive charm that could appeal to either preschoolers or really Xtreme geeks.  Created by Mike and Matt Chapman from a 1996 children's story, Homestar was also developed into a primitive SNES game using Mario Paint. Part of the charm: the creators walk you through Homestar's evolution via the Museum, stored in an old filing cabinet. With 'toons, games, downloads and a store where you can buy tee-shirts, stickers and other iconography to feed your habit.
