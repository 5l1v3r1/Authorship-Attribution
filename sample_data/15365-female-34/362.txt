This is a review written by Daniel. CD Hotlist is a great source for music reviews.   urlLink CD HOTLIST: NEW RELEASES FOR LIBRARIES  Artist: Annie Lennox  Title: BARE  Label: J Records  Cat. #: 8287652072-2  Genre: Pop/Rock  Release type: New  List price: $18.98  Comments: It has been 11 years since Annie Lennox's first solo album and four years since the short-lived Eurythmics reunion. She has returned with a set of self-penned songs that incisively explore the heartbreak and hope of love and relationships. Her voice sounds just as formidable as ever and is really something to behold on this disc. She provides all of the vocals, and hearing Annie Lennox back up Annie Lennox can be breathtaking. Framing the vocals are pop hooks, electric guitar, soul (of the Motown variety) and electronic soundscapes. This is an incredibly moving disc, best appreciated straight through, as the songs join to carry the listener on quite an emotional journey. (DB)
