GERMINATION   The flowers you gave me are beginning  to open on my window sill; red rose taking on a new shape as the day progresses, overpowering the black-eyed susans.  As a gift to Spot, I bring the vase out to the patio where he sprawls  in catlike bliss on the current dining room table.  Stretching out, he purrs, rubbing his face into the leaves, losing his balance in wonder over the smells, and the leaves, and the tiny yellow petals reaching out from their branches  until a lizard catches his eye and it's just me here, remembering the bouquet held in your hands the night before  last.
