urlLink Energy Efficiency & Environmental News: Lighting :   There are many cost effective strategies and technologies available for slashing lighting energy use. As Barney Capehart says; 'If everyone went to the store today and bought high efficiency products or devices for their homes, offices, and factories, Florida could cut its energy use in half.'  Daylighting through skylights and windows can be economical. Only indirect light generates less heat than electric lamps. Skylights can be modified with white paint, lenses, or reflective film to reduce solar heat gain.  Incandescent lamps are the most widely used, and the least efficient. Low pressure sodium vapor lamps, one of the most efficient light sources, uses 9 times less electricity for the same brightness, produce less heat, and lasts 18 times as long as incandescent lamps. Sodium lamp light, however, does not render color naturally.
