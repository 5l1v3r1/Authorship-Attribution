urlLink From the College of Christ Consciousness :  ABOUT FEAR  There are 3 universal fears: (1) abandonment (2) not feeling worthy or good enough (3) loss of trust which = fear of surrender  "Any time there is a fear, it will fall into one or more of these categories.  Each of us is born with one of these three being our core lesson to master in this lifetime.  All of our issues, no matter what they are and no matter how they came about, are related to, and can be traced back to, this core fear.   I will continue to create the same kind of situations, I will keep myself in judgement, I will reinforce the lower vibrational state of thinking that it's someone else's fault, and I will keep myself in the perception of being victimized until I resolve my own fear program and learn a new perception, a new way of thinking. Fear is only a mask of my true desire."  This belief system kicks ass. There are all kinds of exercises on the web site on how to get over yourself and create the reality you want - not in the cheesy way so many self-help shmoes are doing it, but in a straight forward manner that makes sense and can be practiced. I created an Excel spreadsheet to use for the Examining Your Fears exercise you can  urlLink download  if you are interested. It really helped me.  hs
