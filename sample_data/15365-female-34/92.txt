CUT THE STRING   I imagine I will always have this feeling of vague dissastisfaction.  One minute there is endless opportunity, the goal is in sight, then the finish line, then nothing left to cross.  I remind myself.  Another ending is near, and in the end it doesn't ever matter how good it all sounded then.  I have people to face and balls of yarn to unravel, trim, and snip off.  Perfection isn't possible and what are dreams for if not to wake from.  I seek a new path to absorb myself into.  I will avoid those who suffer from self-importance this time.  I have paid for my admittance to this show in more ways than one.  July is change and letting go and the universe seems a lot more trustworthy to me than people if I am any example.  The balloon rises into the sky and is caught by the wind up, up, up.
