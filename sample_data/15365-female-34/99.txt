STILL NOT COMING BACK   I could probably stay awake for the rest of my life in frenzied marathon poetry writing.  It started as a tickle, or a gash, I felt after purging my home of your wood.  Big trash day is coming to take away the rest of you and I returned all of your memories before asking you to please go; you will never do, you will never do.  And as I boast of my pain, I can only imagine what fears take hold of you as you drive away again always never turning back to take me into you arms.  You apologized to me when we parted from our embrace this afternoon.  "I am sorry I am not what you need," you assured me as you let me go.  You never knew that all I asked of you was to keep holding me just a little longer, but knowing that was not worth the asking.  written 8/4/03 4:25am
