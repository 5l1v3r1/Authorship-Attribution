CLOSER   Holding in feelings, drawn and quartered by possible fantasies and improbable futures, I am in wonder and awe.  She gave me a sample bottle of perfume called Miracle to use for such adventures but so far no water has turned to wine.  I am beside myself, inside myself, rehearsing and rehashing, afraid to pick up the phone to call you in the event it may ring.  You are living in a different time I know too well to pretend now my minutes pass the same as yours, measured for mixing in metric increments.  The window of opportunity this time is known and days pass towards your arrival as though leaning forward.  I am unsure about all but my feelings and what I am willing to sacrifice in their name.  Such statements come easy but I am all about the imagined.  It is what I know, eyes full of stars, and an inner knowing of just how the moon will look tonight rising above water.
