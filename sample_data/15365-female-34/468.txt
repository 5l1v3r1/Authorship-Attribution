urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : "Only when we break through the cage of our conditioning and reach the truth of our own hearts can we begin to see life as it really is.  This card challenges us to move away from our preoccupations with other spaces and other times, and stay alert to what is happening in the here and now. Life is a great ocean in which you can play if you drop all your judgments, your preferences and the attachment to the details of your long-term plans. Be available to what comes your way, as it comes. And don't worry if you stumble or fall; just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, have a good laugh, and carry on."  Good advice...I needed it today.  hs
