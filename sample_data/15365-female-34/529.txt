urlLink HOSPICE of North Central Florida : Why do you want to be a Hospice volunteer?  There are two reasons I want to work as a Hospice volunteer. First, I feel a deep desire to work in the field of death and dying. I moved to Gainesville because I want to pursue education for a future career in Hospice. I believe volunteering is an imporant first step for me in defining which direction I will take to do this.  Second, I feel I am ready and capable of being a support to people in Hospice. I experienced two losses which were eased by Hospice in Broward County. The Hospice workers gave incredible care to both of my grandmothers as they were approaching life's end and the volunteers who were there played a critical role. I will always remember the support one of the volunteers gave to my mother during that time just by being there to talk to her.   To sum it all up, I want to give back. I want to do it with my career and I want to start now.  Thank you for asking this question.
