BETRAYED   2:19 am birthed the Aries moon  while sleeping in my bed.  The morning broke through and I wake  to moving sidewalks, the others passing by and standing, and staring, until workday is done.  I leave the crowd behind to shuffle off  this day's remorse, unmet, unmatched.  Daylight is sucked in  by the mouth of night, inhaled, one gulp,  embers, coals;  and it begins, the nightly ritual, a different sidewalk.  In the moment, you are all light and anything can happen;   does.  You break the spell. You cast a shadow.  You are bitter and darker, fire and ice  side by side; driving me  to write.  You are a comfort to none but the man at the gas station who sold you the cans  and I am the fool again, manipulated, talked about, lied about, tossed around  like worth  as you  piss all over your fan club.
