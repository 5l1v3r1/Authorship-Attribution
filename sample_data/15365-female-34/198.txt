urlLink EU, NATO Throw New Lifeline to Macedonia Talks  Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski said talks between leaders of mainstream Macedonian and ethnic Albanian political parties, mediated by special EU and U.S. peace envoys, would resume in Tetovo. But he gave no exact timeframe for resuming dialogue in the city, where fierce three-day battles this week between the NLA and government troops ruined a 15-day truce. One civilian was shot dead there on Thursday, local police said, but no details were immediately available. ``Tetovo is a kind of melting pot for Macedonia. We are going to Tetovo to defend all those achievements,'' Trajkovski said in a reference to the previous round of talks, which had made some progress but stalled over whether Albanian should become an official language in some parts of Macedonia. The West has taken a lead role in trying to prevent a five-month-old ethnic Albanian rebellion in Macedonia from becoming another Balkan war.
