Who Art In Heaven   Hungry to believe that I was the one that asked the moon for forgiveness,  the story is repeated, perhaps for the third time.  I can't be sure,  could be more.  And this I say  to tell you a reason for this  touch deprived angst.  Exuses and reminders, a no win situation or  escape.  Let the dead bury their dead. Release the burdens of your soul. They do not belong to you. They do not control you  Answer it truthfully, here and now.  There is no heavenly father and the one that shows up is years too late,  having forgotten the purpose of his labors, and no rest on the seventh day.
