urlLink Balsamic Moon Phase  Become aware of the wonderful resource your relationships are... they mirror the state of your self-esteem! This is the final waning crescent and marks the transition from the last cycle to the next new moon.   The wisdom you collect during this phase will provide fertile compost for the next cycle.   The light from the moon is disappearing, so no light is shed on the future. You'll have to see with your intuitive senses.   The dark moon is nature's time to rest and recuperate. Time for you to do the same. Go inward, contemplate the past, and tie up loose ends.
