The application of synchronicity is based on the strategy that looking for the meaning in coincidental events is more pragmatic than striving to predict things according to notions of causality, surmised from statistical records.  Einstein once said that "time is what a clock measures."   urlLink A question for the layman:  Recently, astronomers have found that, not only is the universe expanding (But wait! There is no "outside" of the universe!), the rate of expansion is accelerating.  Now, if we choose two distant galaxies as our reference length, then not only is matter shrinking with respect to this reference, its rate of shrinkage should be accelerating.  Whenever an object accelerates there is an associated force.... Can we detect the expanding universe locally?  Have you ever seen an apple fall to the earth?
