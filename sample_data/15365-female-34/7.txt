Carnival   Oh, but to feel this good, this flushed face, your voice,  breathe, breathe.  I am hyperventalating. I am electrified; blowing up like a balloon  and rising to the top of the tent past tight-rope walkers.  I rise up and through,  The canvas melts away to let me pass, and it's all stars and sliver moon,  up, up, up.
