CANCER HOROSCOPE: "This time, everyone knows your position. You've told them. You just came right out and said it. But, as is your style, Hard-Shelled One, you didn't tell them everything. And now it's bothering you. You meant well. You really were going to tell it like it is. But it's extremely difficult to peel away all the layers of your shell. Don't be too hard on yourself. Just keep working on it one layer at a time."  It's creepy when my horoscope is so accurate.
