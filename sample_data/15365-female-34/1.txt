Westwood has  lost weight by eating high protein meat substitutes  and has enjoyed such a lift from his better diet and fitness that he is being sponsored by a well-known meat substitute company ( urlLink Quorn ) for two years. After ending three years in the wilderness since his heady 2000 with two wins last year, Westwood, lying 64th in Europe and with only moderate performances on the U.S. Tour, is aiming to prove he really is back.  'I saw the benefits Darren was getting and I've felt like I needed to do something for a long time,' said Clarke's management stablemate. 'The great thing is, I've lost all this weight and on the (Reuters) statistics I'm (driving) 10-15 yards longer.'
