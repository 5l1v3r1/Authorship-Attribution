WILLING   And out of nowhere and everywhere, all is right with the universe and you are back.  I am green haired, laughing, young, hanging on the swimming pool ladder, catching my breath as yours whispers through the line.  Every moment, back and new in the complexity of an almost no.  I understand without.  You remind me so much with every word how yes there is a now, there is a connection we all experience down, and because such love is required, such tenderness that I know from you for everyone in your gentle stories.  The magic you convey is possible in the moment, every moment.  I am singing in these words. I am dancing the steps painted on the sidewalk.  Take my arm in yours. I am willing.
