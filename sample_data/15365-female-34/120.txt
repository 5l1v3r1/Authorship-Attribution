reflecting the sun   In what ways does life change; thoughts going through and out alongside 64 violins the night the spiritual leader of Palestine was assassinated, just holding  your hand;  to go forward with a dream lived now,  in even the journey north  together;  just to see your face in the morning,  again and again;  and warm skin touching somewhere before sleeping positions are established.  So many stories still untold and  a language left to learn and experiences to share;  while the Aries moon scatters her seeds into  the earth;  rises, wispy outline but still there  reflecting the sun.
