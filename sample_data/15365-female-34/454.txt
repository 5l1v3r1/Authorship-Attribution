urlLink The Harmonic Concordance: The Chart Heard 'round the World  "The total lunar eclipse of November 8, 2003 reveals a moment in time potentially more potent than the "cosmic stampede" in Taurus in May of 2000 or of any of a host of other "important" dates projected for 2003.  The planetary energies present are very appropriate to a moment that would carry the astrological signature of the Ascension.    Consider the qualities of the planets as they are represented through the metaphors of astrology:       The Sun - the primal energy; the cause for being; masculine in nature; the basic will and vitality that inspires life; our creativity and conscious aim;that which expresses the best of who we are,      The Moon - the archetypical feminine; the mother; the personal subconscious mind, memory and imagination the; tidal ebb and flow of emotion; the avenues of habit and instinct; the shelter of home,      Jupiter - the king of the gods; beneficence, good fortune and expansion; the publication of ideals; the higher mind, wisdom and enthusiasm; generosity, optimism and increase on all levels,      Mars - the courage, desire, energy and willingness to act;  the stimulation of passion; the ability to be the spiritual warrior,      Saturn - the physical bones of the Earth and our bodies; the disciplinarian and 'tester' of our metal;  the limitations of the physical; endurance,  perseverance,  and stability, and finally,      Chiron   - the crystal rainbow bridge between physicality and spirit, the inner and outer planets; the wounded healer; Christ consciousness; initiation; the interface between God and Godling."
