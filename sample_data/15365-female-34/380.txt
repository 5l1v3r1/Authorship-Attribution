The contemplation for this week is:  "An artist uses color to paint different forms on canvas: cows and tigers, rivers and mountains, houses and trees. Similarly, God has created this infinitely varied universe with His sublime skill. He exists as the Consciousness that pervades everything, that invents infinite colors and generates marvelous forms - all for the sake of love and beauty and joy. Everything that exists is for giving satisfaction to the inner Self." -- Swami Muktananda
