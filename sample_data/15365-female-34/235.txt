urlLink How Cheese is Made  Milk is separated and standardised to obtain the desired fat content for the cheese. Some factories like Lichfield also add or remove protein to obtain a desired protein level. It is then pasteurised and transferred to tanks where starter culture and a rennet enzyme is added.  Curdling Rennet, usually obtained from the stomach of calves, reacts with the casein protein in the milk to convert it into curd, the main element of cheese. This curd also contains a large proportion of whey, a watery substance full of sugar.
