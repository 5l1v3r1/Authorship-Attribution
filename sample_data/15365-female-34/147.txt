urlLink Current Phase: Balsamic in Cancer   MOONRISE: 3 AM     MOONSET: Mid-afternoon Waning: inner reflection     Keywords: Collect the Wisdom, Envision the Future   A willingness to lighten up eases tension! Use our August Journal to benefit from some thoughtful re-organization.   This is the final waning crescent and marks the transition from the last cycle to the next new moon.   The wisdom you collect during this phase will provide fertile compost for the next cycle.   The light from the moon is disappearing, so no light is shed on the future. You'll have to see with your intuitive senses.   The dark moon is nature's time to rest and recuperate. Time for you to do the same. Go inward, contemplate the past, and tie up loose ends.  Allow your activity to be spiritual and intellectual rather than physical.  Source:  urlLink Moonsurfing
