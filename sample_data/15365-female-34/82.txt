BETWEEN THE NOTES   I remember talking with you at the table, you in your assigned place, and me in mine, even though the parents were gone.  You told me I was too young to think about things like the meaning of life,  or what my purpose here  would be.  You are supposed to be out having fun, you told me, and I would ask you  what if thinking about these things was my idea of fun.  I could barely convince myself and you never hid your pity for my petty struggle to find and an answer. between the notes in our conversation.
