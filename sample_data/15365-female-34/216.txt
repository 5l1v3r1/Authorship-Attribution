INTERNET ACCESS THROUGH POWER LINES? THEY'RE WORKING ON IT Might you one day connect to the Internet via the nearest wall socket? It's possible -- technically, anyway. The mission of the newly minted joint-venture company Linecom Inc. will be to develop and deploy "power line communication" systems in Japan, which would push Internet access onto existing power lines.  Formed among Kansai Electric Power Co. and Matsushita Electric Works Ltd. in Japan and Israel's Itran Communications, the new company will capitalize on Kansai Electric's knowledge of power-distribution systems, Itran's power line communication (PLC) technology and Matsushita's expertise in system integration and product design to develop a complete, start-to-finish solution, from modems to power-line networking equipment. Itran has developed a special modem that links to the Internet via household electrical outlets. Power company Kansai Electric intends to launch the service once the the Japanese government deregulates the use of high-frequency bands for PLC, which is expected to happen early next year.
