Current Phase: Full Moon in Cancer  Saturday 5:49 AM EST Moon 27 Cancer (until Tuesday) The Full Moon is the time when the Moon reflects the greatest amount of the Sun's light. The Earth is astronomically poised between the Sun and the Moon, enabling us to see two different sides of ourselves clearly. This opening of increased awareness traditionally makes the Full Moon a beneficial time for meditation on personal and worldwide issues. There's literally an electrical energy build-up before a Full Moon and a release just after the peak. At the Full Moon, the seeds sown at the last New Moon are ready to be harvested and used ~~ we reap what we've sown.    Cancer Traits:  Sensitive and a little on the timid side, protective and extremely receptive, ruled by strong emotions and intuition. Cancers can change moods in a significant way, two or three times in any day. Creativity and emotionalism may dominate.  Should mix in an interesting way with the full moon. Be open to it!
