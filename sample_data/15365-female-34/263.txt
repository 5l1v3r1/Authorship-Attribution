I have been watching TV this past weekend while I am staying with my Grandmother. The US government is really bringing me down. What is happening? I saw a speech given by Aaron McGruder on CSPAN and was really inspired. Change must come. What is going to have to happen to bring people together? What can I do to make a difference? Who am I to be an activist? I don't feel like I am eloquent enough to express my feelings adequately.  It is frustrating as hell.
