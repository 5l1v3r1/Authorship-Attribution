STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS   If I could quiet my thoughts, wrap the bundle in  soft and warm, to crib for naps or watching stars,  would the unknown make itself a little less obvious?  All day I have been beyond behind wonder and not knowing, pretending bliss,  the gift of lack of commitment.  I am too far removed and too soon confused.  I am missing out on missing out.  Could there be a balance in geography, a new spot to look on the map, easier on the neck?  Snap around and fall  in line?  I am breaking the rules still but  still not enough.  And in a round, my generation sings.  We apologize to all of those who have sacrificed their lives in the hope we would be more than what we have become.  You should have asked us first what we were capable of.
