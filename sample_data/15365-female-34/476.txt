Your Week in Focus by John - December 08 to 14  There is no doubt that you are more serious about your objectives than you have been for some time, HEATHER. Yet, on the other hand, you are also a lot more fearful of failing. It seems that you have the choice to have more faith in yourself and to stretch yourself to try new things, or you can instead choose to ignore the opportunities banging on your door, and carry on in the same old way. Yet the influences around you at this time will encourage you to explore new options. Venus and Mercury in your opposite sign of Capricorn may mean that friends, loved ones, and anyone you are with on a regular basis will all try to encourage you to do things that they know will make you feel a whole lot better. You need a touch of ecstasy after all that you have been through. And your friends want to see you sing and dance, love and be filled with joy. Much of what you will be combating at this time will be the devils within, rather than the circumstances without. The Sun conjuncts Pluto in Sagittarius, which means that a change of rules or a new project may bring a delightful new element into your working week.
