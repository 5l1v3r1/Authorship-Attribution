None of us live in Hartford and will be unable to keep the contents of the home save for a few mementos. We are looking for any local charity which has the capability of picking up furniture and other valuable items which can be donated. I have not had success trying to find a resource online and was hoping you might be able to point us in the right direction. Thank you!"
