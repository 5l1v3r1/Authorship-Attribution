The Romance of Words   If only  our ownly responsibility was to just be real;  cream color petals, pink at the edge;  the stars in a ripple of water;  grass underfoot, soft, and warm ground underneath;  an owl on the telephone pole;  the ladies that nod and smile on the morning walk;  coffee at ten  o'clock pm;  and a phone call with an old friend.
