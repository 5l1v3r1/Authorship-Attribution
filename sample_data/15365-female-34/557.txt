urlLink quotes of the day - qotd.org :  "People are unreasonable, illogical, and self-centered.   Love them anyway. If you do good, people will accuse you of having selfish ulterior motives.   Do good anyway. If you are successful, you will gain false friends and true enemies.   Succeed anyway. The good you do today will be forgotten by tomorrow.   Do good anyway. Honesty and bluntness make you vulnerable.   Be honest and blunt anyway. What you spend years building can be destroyed overnight.   Build it anyway. People really need help but may attack you if you help them.   Help them anyway. Even if you live your life, you will die someday.   Live your life anyway. Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth.   Give the world the best you have anyway."   - Mother Teresa
