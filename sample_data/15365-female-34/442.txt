One of the songs from Daniel's mix of songs he sent to me on CD. He should really be a DJ. Daniel is my own personal DJ. He is also a fantastic music critic at  urlLink CD Hotlist . You can find his reviews under DB. Thank you, Daniel.   urlLink Bjork lyrics - Big Time Sensuality  i can sense it  something important is about to happen  it's coming up  it takes courage to enjoy it the hardcore and the gentle big time sensuality  we just met  and i know i'm a bit too intimate but something is coming up and we're both included  it takes courage to enjoy it the hardcore and the gentle big time sensuality  i don't know my future after this weekend and i don't want to  it takes courage to enjoy it the hardcore and the gentle big time sensuality
