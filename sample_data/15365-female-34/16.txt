Out of Town Suit   Waiting for the others to join me at the meeting, I look over my shoulder, suspicious as I type  poetry, in my corporate suit and coffee at hand.  Later, the attendees arrive; two sets of eyes looking for leadership and direction, and all I want to do is get this down on paper,  barely able to contain my need to explain.  There are handouts and brochures scattered about, and nobody knows what's going on at this account.  I am watching them both for inspiration, the way he draws a wobbly arrow in his daytimer, or the laugh-hairflip combo from the woman across my way, beautiful and lost at 23.  I am taking control, and setting expectations.  I am the senior member at the table with no time for distractions.  Moments later, cell phones ring and the meeting is adjourned.  I open back up my laptop and type this.
