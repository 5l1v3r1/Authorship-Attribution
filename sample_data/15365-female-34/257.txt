urlLink LUSCIOUS JACKSON LYRICS - Soothe Yourself   i've been soother and i've been wife tried to solve your life stuck with you through your rainy days thought that it was just a phase when the sun came out i tried to get away and fly but the needs we had did not subside what a way for our love to die  i've been hiding behind my gifts i give until it starts to rip the skin is torn where i begin the thread is worn and might give in underneath it all i feel the eyes of all the things that i despise can i fight them off with sticks and stones? can i fight them off alone?  soothe yourself [x3]  now i'm thinking about my own advice if i could soothe myself it might be nice callin' names ain't the same no more took a look and locked that door memories and cold hard facts watched it all come rushing back all the times i told you what to do all the times i thought i knew  soothe yourself [x4]
