PRINCESS   Sometimes she can sweep the pages into nothingness; into an eight ball corner pocket, stuffed with her short attention span for present details.  The past ruffles its feathers against  the girl with a lifetime (still short) of boxes filled with collections of what  can not be bought.  Dreams may come, and she may call names  out into the darkness like memory cares enough to answer her at all.  She asks if true love is as real as stars or bright  planetary nebulae, a fuel that burns to tell us something  about our own origins.  All remembered at once, it is sudden as  dissapoint ment  and the gravity of a single misplaced thought, found still searching for the pea under her matress.
