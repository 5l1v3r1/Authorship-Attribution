Cancer Horoscope  Your skin may not be able to contain you now, as it feels like you are ready to shed whatever is now holding you back. As a snake outgrows its skin, you, too, have moved beyond the teachers and authorities that have brought you this far. But you're not going to escape without first finishing what you've started.     urlLink General Daily Overview  The Moon enters Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, at 6:02 am EDT -- thus beginning the cycle anew as it does every month. We feel the need to initiate action, to act on new feelings, to tackle a new project and in general, to jump in to circumstances before we know the consequences. Additionally, the Moon in Aries forms a tense square with Mars in Cancer, making us struggle with the question of action versus inaction. We feel ready to express our feelings, yet we tend to hold something back, as if our survival depended on it.
