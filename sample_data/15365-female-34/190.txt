urlLink Rearranging Furniture : Define the functions of the room. Clearly understand how you use the space.  Establish a focal point or two. You might include the television, fireplace, a window or an aquarium just to name a few. You must decide where you want to focus attention so you can arrange the furniture accordingly.   Don't block traffic flow with furniture. Some good rules to follow:  Allow three feet for pathways in and out of a room.   Chairs and sofas should be no more than eight feet apart (too much distance makes conversation difficult).  Keep about 18 inches between the sofa and coffee table.
