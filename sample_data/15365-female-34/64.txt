APPEARANCE   PMS makes more sense than another 10 years of this goddamn job everyone says is so great because it pays the bills  so it goes  as he'd say  as for me I have had enough  as for me my last never is worked  I'd have to be out of my mind to stay another minute  I'd have to be drugged and sacked in burlap  Even that sounds like more fun than another drive on the turnpike  back and forth endlessly  making someone look good
