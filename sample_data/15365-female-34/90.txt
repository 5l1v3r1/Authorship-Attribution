BEFORE THE CREDITS   Maybe the answer is to belong nowhere; let time ride over your back like rain falling through a patch of sun, sing your song into the night to harmonize with locusts, breathe, embrace moments even spent in woods, and if a tree falls then who cares.  There have been crueler summers, the time to let my heart out to play, learning there is beauty too in suffering.  I am more than less I was as dogs bark and the room is still save the ceiling fan having it's own gentle caress on my shoulders.  I bleed willingly, joyfully, believing in magic over cold logic and thoughts dancing, meaning nothing.  Real is as real does. The movie playing in my mind is a double feature. I order vegetable foo young and select this seat.
