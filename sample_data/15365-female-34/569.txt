urlLink Siddha Yoga Weekly Contemplation June 28 :            The heart is supreme Consciousness.            It is the power of bliss,            The power of freedom.            Undying and unborn,            It is the sum total            Of both existence and nonexistence.            To savor this bliss and freedom,            You must make a steady effort            To enter the silence of the heart.                               --Gurumayi Chidvilasananda
