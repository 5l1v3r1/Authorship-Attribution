urlLink From Emmanuel's Book III :   "There is no one way to live your life. There is only the step-by-step adventure with no knowable distant plan. When one is saying yes, it does not matter upon what the foot rests at a step's completion. Wherever it is, it will be the perfect place to say yes again."
