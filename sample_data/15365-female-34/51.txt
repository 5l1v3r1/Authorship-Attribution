THE FIRST COME IS FIRST SERVED   Why argue when you can persuade, I asked you last night.  The word sashayed  along my tongue,  and I am a snake of influence,  slither and glide, convince and  encourage.  Harmless to most, I carry no poison. I delight in commiseration.  My condolences are no sin.  Even scandal can light the way at times  when dark  is bright.
