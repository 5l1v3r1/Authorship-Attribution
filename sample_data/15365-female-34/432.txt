"It is critical to serve others,  to contribute actively to others' well-being.  I often tell practitioners that they should adopt  the following principle:     regarding one's own personal needs,       there should be       as little involvement or obligation as possible,    but regarding service to others,        there should be        as many possible involvements       and obligations as possible. This should be the ideal of a spiritual person." - His Holiness the Dalai Lama
