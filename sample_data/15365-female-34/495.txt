"Every new beginning is beautiful, filled with extraordinary opportunities, like a door opening on a whole new life. In beginnings there is a childlike innocence, and this innocence is filled with humility, filled with patience. On the spiritual path, these two virtues are paramount: humility and patience. To a beginner they are readily available.  A beginner knows he doesn't know, so there is humility. A beginner knows for certain something is going to happen, so there is patience. With humility and patience as his support, a beginner advances into the unknown to discover a glorious event yet to occur.  Even after achieving the goal of all spiritual practices, you cannot be indifferent to a new beginning. A beginning is forever full of magic, enchantment, and treasures to be explored. No matter what the occasion, a new beginning must be approached with a mystical awareness of its potential."  - Swami Chidvilasanda
