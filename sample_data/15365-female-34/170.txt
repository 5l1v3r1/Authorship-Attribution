urlLink CAPRICORN LUNAR CYCLE  by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com  Dec. 23 - Jan 20 The Capricorn lunar cycle reminds you that discipline is liberation. As the light returns, prepare to enter a year of love, relationship, responsibility, and healing under the vibration of the number "6". Heed the call to consolidate your resources, set new limits and goals, and be more self-reliant.   Mercury continues to move in retrograde motion till January 6th.  Reflect on the lessons you've learned and get clear about where you need to set new limits and boundaries so you can accomplish your goals.  Think out of the box for alternative solutions to areas calling for healing.   As the month progresses, strike a balance between your desires for status and achievement in the outer world with time spent attending to family, feelings, and rest and renewal of body and soul. Utilize challenging situations to decide what needs to change. Then make a comprehensive plan and remember that patience, persistence and preparation are valuable resources.   Last month's lunar energy encouraged you to set off with providential trust, hope, and a belief in good fortune. This month's energy requires that you  align with your highest intentions and diligently prepare for your journey leaving nothing to chance .
