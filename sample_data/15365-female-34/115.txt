RIGHT NOW   letting it all come and go and flow without regard to time or spaces between us and  even words and even dreams and even and even  gentle strength  learning not to direct the waves but to sink soar rise the crest and soft back into petals  those times when you are not and those times when you are  the right balance towards upwards the middle path and back down casting no rings on the water
