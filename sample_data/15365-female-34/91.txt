THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE   For seven years I have lived next door to a mermaid.  At night, she hangs her tails from the line stretched across her car port.  I know her name and she knows mine.  The rest of my neighbors are strangers, stranger still these days filling spaces with SUVs and children taken in hand.  I have outgrown this home and am outclassed, and am outmortgaged, and am outside taking the recycling out for Friday wondering how it all got so different from me.
