Now is the Time -- Hafiz   Now is the time to know That all that you do is sacred.   Now, why not consider A lasting truce with yourself and God.    Now is the time to understand That all your ideas of right and wrong Were just a child's training wheels To be laid aside When you finally live With veracity And love.    Hafiz is a divine envoy Whom the Beloved Has written a holy message upon.    My dear, please tell me, Why do you still Throw sticks at your heart And God?    What is it in that sweet voice inside That incites you to fear?   Now is the time for the world to know That every thought and action is sacred.   This is the time For you to compute the impossibility That there is anything But Grace.    Now is the season to know That everything you do Is sacred.
