urlLink October Horoscope - Cancer : June 22 - July 22 :  "Saturn continues to confront you with the choice between staying safe in all your survival mechanisms, or being alive in your vulnerability, your openness and your essence. It is a strange and beautiful thing to have to let go of all that you have learned in order to take the next step.  'Clinging to the known is clinging to a corpse. It does not need courage to drop the clinging; in fact it needs courage to go on clinging to a corpse. You just have to see... That which is familiar to you, which you have lived  what has it given? Where have you reached? Are you not still empty? Is there not immense discontent, a deep frustration and meaninglessness? Somehow you go on managing, hiding the truth and creating lies to remain engaged, involved. This is the question: to see with clarity that everything that you know is of the past, it is already gone. It is part of a graveyard. Do you want to be in a grave, or do you want to be alive?'" - Osho, "Courage"
