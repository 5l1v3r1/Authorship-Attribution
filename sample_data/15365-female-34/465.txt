urlLink Rufus Wainwright - Want One - I Don't Know What It Is lyrics :  "don't know what it is but you got to do it I don't know where to go But you got to be there I don't know where to fall But I know that its comfortable where I don't know where it is  Putting all of my time In learning to care And a bucket of rhymes I threw up somewhere Want a locket of who Made me lose my perfunctory view Of all that is around And of all that I do"
