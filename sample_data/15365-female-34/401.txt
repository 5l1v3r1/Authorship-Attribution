urlLink UNM - Quantum 2001 - Great Place, Great Art :   Homage to Grandmother Earth  - Youn Ja Johnson, 1994 "Located in the Yale Mall of the main campus, this piece consists of granite pillars engraved with seed and plant forms surrounding a gentle pool of water. The piece is part of a cycle of similar works created by the artist to celebrate the bounty and goodness of the earth. Youn Ja Johnson, a distinguished artist in the United States and in her native Korea, is a resident of Albuquerque and graduate of UNM, earning both undergraduate and graduate degrees. She generously donated the piece to the University and served an instrumental role in the installation and placement of the piece."  Youn Ja Johnson, if you ever wander across this page, I really appreciate the gift of the fountain. I went to Albuquerque less than two month's after my own Grandmother passed away and your beautiful fountain brought me healing, peace and a renewed connection with my Grandmother's memory. It was unexpected and so needed and I thank you for sharing your talent and compassion.
