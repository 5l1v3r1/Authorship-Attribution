I am looking up all kinds of people from my past now. Today I looked up Karl Hirsch, my first boyfriend. We dated while we were in highschool in Phoenix. I think it ended badly, I was just 16 - my excuse. It was really weird to find him on google.   urlLink Article: KarlHirschHasn'tStalled   urlLink IMDB: Karl's Movie Career   The internet is an amazing thing.
