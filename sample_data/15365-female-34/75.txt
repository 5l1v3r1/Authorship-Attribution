BEFORE AND AFTER    The rain taps its fingers on the tin roof above my patio,  keeping me from a drive North to  Melbourne to check in, luggage in hand,  another night out  before  a morning meeting, and a few words, and a few notes, and a  drive West to  Tampa to check in, luggage in hand, and   another night out.
