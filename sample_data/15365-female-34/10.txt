5:30 Wake Up Call   The dream ended abruptly, your voice on the line  and I couldn't roll over and turn it off, knowing time is too short to make decisions.  You tell me what love is;  unbroken speech, poetry before sun up and you tell me what love is;  again.  I listen, but there is more in my silence.  I listen, my inner abacus clicking and clacking against and over the crackling static that does not come from a clear connection;  and you tell me what I am afraid of;  again.  I have no time for these  parlor games;  cheap satoris leaving others open mouthed and astonished,  but not me.  I dealt those same cards eight and half years ago, my ego fed by those same eyes, that same hunger for confirmation seldom remembered the next day, and so the repetition continues.  You tell me what I want because you are afraid to hear the words from my lips and in an instant crack your mirror  or reflect something you will not remember tomorrow.
