urlLink Be My Tongue : "Cymothoa exigua, a crustacean, makes its home inside the mouth of a fish. It makes itself so much at home, in fact, that it actually removes, than takes over the duties of, its host's tongue.  The parasite does not actually bite off the host's existing tongue. It does, however, suck enough blood from it that the organ shrivels-up and atrophies. The parasite then employs hooks on its underside to attach itself to the remaining stub. Consequently, the host is able to use it as a replacement tongue for food manipulation, allowing the host to eat as usual. C. exiqua grabs a meal from the particles that float free as the fish eats."   urlLink Somebody wrote a play based on this concept.  There are so many interesting things in life. How could anybody ever be bored?
