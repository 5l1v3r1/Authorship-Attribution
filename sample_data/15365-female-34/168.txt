urlLink LIBRA LUNAR CYCLE   Sept. 25 - Oct. 24, 2003 Fall is officially here and the waning half of the yearly lunar cycle begins! After perfecting and organizing the resources you developed over the last six months, you're ready to  share your creative and emotional harvest  with others.   This cycle emphasizes  balance  in all areas of your life. Adapt your health regimen to the seasonal change and be sure to include relaxation and meditation while allocating time for inward and outward activities.   Existing relationships, social interactions and new partnerships come to center stage. First strengthen your relationship with yourself by asking Spirit to help you in releasing old hurts and resentments so your personal wholeness is supported.   Collaboration and compromise provide win-win solutions to challenges confronting you, as long as you maintain your individual sense of balance. View yourself and the world with a loving heart, an open mind, and remember the underlying divine spark in others. Libra's ruler, Venus, emphasizes balance, beauty, grace, harmony, peace and love. These qualities are available right now and they begin within  you .  Interpretation by  urlLink Moonsurfing.com
