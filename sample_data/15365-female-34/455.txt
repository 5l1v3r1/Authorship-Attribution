urlLink Coming Nov. 8: Second Total Lunar Eclipse of 2003  Skywatchers across most of the Americas as well as much of Europe and Africa will have their second opportunity in 2003 to view of one of nature's most beautiful spectacles: A total eclipse of the Moon. Weather permitting, the total phase of the November eclipse will be visible across much of North America, all of South America, as well as all of Europe and Africa and the western half of Asia. That's a potential viewing audience of nearly 3 billion people.   The most noticeable part of this eclipse will come when the Moon begins to enter the Earths umbra. A small scallop of darkness will begin to appear on the Moon's left edge at 6:32 p.m. EST. The Moon is expected to take 3 hours and 33 minutes to completely pass through the umbra.
