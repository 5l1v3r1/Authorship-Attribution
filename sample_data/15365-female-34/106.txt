THE MOON WAS STILL UP   Anger and pain I can not understand because they are so far underneath your skin even poetry does not release from you their rewards.  You compete against the music played to drown you out on purpose as though guitar light could flood the landscape yesterday bright or for pieces of the puzzle glued on cardboard to signify an end.  Struggle is synthesized into the equalizing waves of water washing over a brand new day and you are the  lighthouse again against rocky shores.  Memory unlatches the paper petroglyphs at exactly the right time even though the words are too faint to hear over the lyrics of Van Morrison or the possibility of being completely wrong about all of it.
