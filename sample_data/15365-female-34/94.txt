GO ON   For five days, I have been without my mirror.  I guess if this shirt looks right with this skirt with this look, sideways glancing, is this really me?  It is spring at the piata party. My amnesia has lifted  from the time I was hit by the bat. I am looking around at all the kids.  Tonight even the poet asks where the moon is and in Gemini, even I look rational.  Thoughts stretch out in the sun and flip.  Everyone else has found the answers but me.  I have spent my life interviewing the wrong  person.
