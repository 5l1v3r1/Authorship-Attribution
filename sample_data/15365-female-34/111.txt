SOMEPLACE NEW AGAIN   I have had it with trolling for visions. The fish never bite and  I feel kind of funny pulling them up from the depths, considering the bends and all.  Though flashy colors and neon  have always caught my fancy, I realize there is more to pretty than that which remains when eyes  are closed.  Life is everywhere and I am.  Life is a kaleidoscope and I am up late feeling  the magic of dreams cast by my neighbors, and happiness  is found in simply being happy.  After all,  freedom isn't about freeing everyone else.  Let everyone find his own cloud monsters and  try to break them up with the power of his will alone.  Let everybody find her own set of flannel sheets to sleep comfortably at night.  We ride our bikes on parallel paths and I am  no more than just a few inches from you.  We climb our mountains with the same  weight of gravity tugging at our boots and I have no idea if this rope will hold.  The end result is never really an ending, but begin here just in case you think you have arrived someplace new again.
