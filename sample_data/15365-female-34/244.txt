Saturday Modern Subculture Search    urlLink MODERN PRIMITIVES  The focus of the modern primitive subculture seems to be on cosmic ideas, body manipulation, technology, mind tripping, and redefining the current understanding of time. Sounds interesting but I am having a hard time with the piercing part. I spent a year in Fort Wayne, Indiana working at Claires boutique in some mall piercing and accessorizing a glut of ears. Looking at piercing as something mystical is a real stretch for me.   If anyone reading this now considers himself/herself to be a Modern Primitive, please contact me. I would sincerely like to learn more about your ideas.
