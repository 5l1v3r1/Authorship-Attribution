urlLink My Tarot Reading For Today : Your situation is changing. Your future seems uncertain. Take heart and wait it out -- peace will return in its own time. In the meanwhile, do not waste your precious life force worrying about something you cannot control. The Situation position refers to the general set of influences that surround you and affect your personal experience of peace. We all have to deal with conflict and are affected by the process.  When the Wheel of Fortune is in this position, your circumstances may be constantly fluctuating. The changes are driven by a force no mortal can control. Your immediate future is so uncertain. No one can blame you for feeling a bit overwhelmed or confused. Still, you need not succumb to despair. The force in operation is the great washing machine of life. If you can put up with the churning, the rinse cycle and the final spin, then the end result will leave you restored, like new.  As with the wheel, what appears up will soon be down and vice versa. In the end, everything will be resolved. It is still a challenge to keep your composure in mid-cycle, however, because the part of you that prefers control feels helpless. Wait and watch from a quiet, meditative place inside yourself, and as you do so, try to absorb and understand the process. You'll be fine if you go with the flow.
