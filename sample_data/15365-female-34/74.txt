OFF THE HOOK   It's not even nine when there is an attempt to cop-opt my crisis; my story at last told, and everything hangs in air like dreams are not even possible.  The day passes in sleep and the strain of listening to numbers talk, screaming down columns in an Excel spreadsheet 5 cups of coffee can not even animate.  Freedom charges another debit against my account and the messenger hits the floor before the bullets fly.  (written 5/21)
