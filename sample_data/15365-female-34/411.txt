urlLink Tarot Reading :  "The situation is unpredictable. Empty the vessel, releasing any preconceived agenda. Allow yourself and your potential love interest to be guided from a still, calm place within. The card that lands in the Situation position refers to social or circumstantial factors which could be affecting your life at this time. When the Fool is in this position, your upcoming romantic situation may be undefined and open-ended. You do not know, nor can you even begin to guess, what is happening in another person's head. This can create either a feeling of panic or relief. On the other hand, having no blueprint frees you up from the pressure of expectations. You are also free to do something really foolish because there are no rules set out for you!   This is a test of your own internal guidance system. Can you refrain from getting desperate about your potential relationship in the absence of structure?"
