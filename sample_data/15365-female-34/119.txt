Cloud  Space   During the time when you have not  yet been to life or death;  everything everyone told you was important;  still  is.  Dreams are something to interpret to find your inner questions.  All purposes must have a goal at the end to cross and the sooner, the better.  You have not yet seen the bricks.  Cloud space on blue sky that should be white.  What is clear but the absence of something blocking.  Less to edit endlessly in the head and  the players still seeming to act from a different script.  Before the veil is lifted, before it is too indescribably beautiful to believe, innocent as the smooth skin on the side of a blade of grass, and you might even forget sometimes to look at the sunset or to remember when the moon will next be full.  Easier  to love in another while simply passing through the absence of clouds.
