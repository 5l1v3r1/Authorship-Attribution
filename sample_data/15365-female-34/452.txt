urlLink PRESS RELEASE ( PR Web) Millions Celebrate Most Spectacular Planetary Alignment in 6,000 Years - November 8/9, 2003 "The Harmonic Concordance" : "The total lunar eclipse is part of what is known in astrology as a Grand Sextile pattern  a wonderful, harmonious flow of energy between six planets in our solar system. Within this pattern is yet another powerful pattern known as The Star of David, an important mystic symbol.  This is the most significant alignment in the 6,000 year span between 3,000 BC and 3,000 CE. This is one powerful moment in time -- but its effects can last for centuries to come.   The general consensus is that (at the very least) this moment is likely to bestow grace and blessings upon those who spend this time and use the high energies it produces with their hearts and minds focused spiritually.  There have been numerous speculations about what might happen during this time. Some are rather extreme, to say the least. Some expect to see the first wave of Ascension take place. Others are waiting for spaceships to take us away. Still others wonder if the astrological chart is foretelling a type of universal rapture.   Blaze believes it is not so much about the outward events, but an opportunity for to make this time as spiritually powerful as possible. In other words, be spiritually proactive; dont wait for things to happen.  Powerful planetary events can and often do coincide with events in the world around us, and these can indeed be regarded as signposts from the Cosmos. Astrology is a language of the Divine, and It uses such events to talk to us.   However, first we have to raise our vibrations through spiritual work and meditation, in order to attune ourselves to what is being said. Once we learn to do this, then indeed we can expect sublime events,"
