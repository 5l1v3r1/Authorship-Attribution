urlLink Turkish women get equal rights  The new year sees the start of a quiet revolution in Turkish society, when centuries of legally enshrined inequality between the sexes are brought to an end.   From 1 January, Turkish men are no longer regarded by law as the head of the family. These latest measures included in sweeping reforms to the country's civil code are described by Turkey's Justice Minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, as the result of no less than 50 years' hard work.   Women are now legally allowed to take a job without first seeking their spouse's permission, and their husbands no longer have the right to decide unilaterally where a couple will live.   But by far the most significant element of the new legislation is the provision that married women are entitled to an equal share of joint assets in the event of divorce.
