IN VAIN   There is nothing I have to say that hasn't been felt by someone else and this is my good fortune.  All of the angst and doubt and questions are not in vain if written down and someone should pick up the pieces to rest her head a while.  Some nights it is not so easy to sleep without a pillow.
