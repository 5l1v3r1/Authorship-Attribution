Asking For Stories   Words pool along the base and cling to the wick for a moment before letting go.  I watch them slide.  My thoughts are no longer my own. I am reaching for a pen. I am looking for some paper.  I am trying to catch the drips that have eluded me for six years;  the background conversations, the inner dialogue that kept me company on the turnpike but would not stain the page.  I am staring into the flame now, noticing the colors and shadows on the wall,  finger families looking up with wide eyes and asking for stories again.
