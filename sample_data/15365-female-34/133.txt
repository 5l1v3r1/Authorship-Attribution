Current Phase:  urlLink Last Quarter Moon Phase   The full moon was a real thwack to the head but the disseminating Sagittarius/Fire moon on April 30th started to bring the world back into focus with a flurry of ideas and self-confidence. The moon will change to Last Quarter in Aquarius/Air on Saturday, May 4. The half-light, half-dark phase brings on the need for adaptive behavior and a need for the new. It is the "fall" stage of the moon's cycle which always evokes a crisis in consciousness between past, present and future.  Sources:  Moonsurfing   The Moon Oracle  Personal Intuition
