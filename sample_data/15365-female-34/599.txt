Stepping Westward (excerpt)   What is green in me darkens, muscadine.  If woman is inconstant, good, I am faithful to  ebb and flow, I fall in season and now  is a time of ripening. If her part  is to be true, a north star,  good, I hold steady in the black sky  and vanish by day, yet burn there  in blue or above quilts of cloud.  There is no savor more sweet, more salt  that to be glad to be what, woman,  and who, myself, I am, a shadow  that grows longer as the sun moves, drawn out  on a thread of wonder.  ~ Denise Levertov (Poems, 1960-1967)
