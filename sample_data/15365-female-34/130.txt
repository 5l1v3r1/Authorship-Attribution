urlLink Current Phase: Full Moon in Sagittarius  The Full Moon is when the symbolic seed flowers. Historically, the Indians of what are now the northern and eastern United States called the May Full Moon the "Full Flower Moon." This is the culmination of the waxing cycle and the beginning of the waning cycle. The full moon phase can bring on high emotions. This is typically a good time to concentrate on meditation, spirituality, creativity and matters of the home.  The Sagittarius energy is one of fire and restlessness. The message of Sagittarius encourages us to reach goal after goal as we follow our path. At the same time, we may be reminded of the need for balance and down time. Remember to to "be here now" over the next few days.  Sources:  urlLink Full Moon Days   urlLink Moon Lore   urlLink Sagittarius - Full Moon Meditation
