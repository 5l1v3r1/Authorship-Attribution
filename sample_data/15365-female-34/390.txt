"Understanding the way of the world, the sport and play of destiny, the continuity of the waking and dream states, a wise person becomes filled with the extraordinary mystery of the formless, and feels lighthearted with this simple awareness. Then he naturally takes delight in the game. He lives in a natural way. His is the true life in which there is no basis for worry, no binding limitation. All that remains for him everywhere is the infinite flame of the Self." -  urlLink Swami Muktananda
