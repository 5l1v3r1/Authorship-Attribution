Accidental Rhyme   It comes out like this, running water against porcelain, into a glass, or bottle,  captured for espresso, mixed into soup, taken with vitamins, or with a $20 placebo when I am lucky.  It quenches my thirst or leaves me bloated. When I jump up and down, I can hear it always inside me sloshing around.
