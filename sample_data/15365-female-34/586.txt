The Journey   Above the mountains the geese turn into the light again  Painting their black silhouettes on an open sky.  Sometimes everything has to be enscribed across the heavens  so you can find the one line already written inside you.  Sometimes it takes a great sky to find that  small, bright and indescribable wedge of freedom in your own heart.  Sometimes with the bones of the black sticks left when the fire has gone out  someone has written something new in the ashes of your life.  You are not leaving you are arriving.  ~ David Whyte
