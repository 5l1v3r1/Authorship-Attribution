In Control   When I get there, will I have to  climb over your expectations to  get in?  You,  always on the look  out for true love or  the next best thing.  Maybe I'm the latter, or ladder, whose rungs you have yet to climb.  Maybe I'm the light you left on by mistake.  It's enough for me now to be humble.  It keeps me in control.
