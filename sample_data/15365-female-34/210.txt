urlLink Biodiversity Shrinks as Farm Breeds Die Out  Over the past 15 years, 300 out of 6,000 breeds of farm animal identified by the Rome-based U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (news - web sites) (FAO) have become extinct. Latest information suggests that 30 percent of the world's farm animal breeds are at risk of disappearing, and their valuable traits, such as their ability to adapt to harsh conditions, disease, drought and poor quality feed, could be lost too. ``Once you lose a genetic resource, it's gone forever,'' said Ricardo Cardellino, the FAO's senior officer for animal genetic resources. ``We don't know what we will need in future in terms of genetic resources.''
