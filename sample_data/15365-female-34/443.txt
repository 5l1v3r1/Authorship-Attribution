urlLink FTAA lite seen as deal-breaker  By STEVEN CHASE Miami  Canada and other countries warned yesterday that a bid by the United States and Brazil to significantly narrow the scope of a proposed free-trade area of the Americas agreement could derail the talks under way in Miami. A group opposed to the barebones deal  including Canada, Chile, and Mexico  says the 'FTAA lite' salvage proposal Washington and Brasilia have cobbled together to salvage talks is insufficient to keep negotiations moving forward.  'This is simply a papering over of differences and is not enough to establish a basis for continuing [talks],' a source close to FTAA negotiations in Miami said yesterday. The move by Washington and Brasilia to a lowest-common-denominator FTAA deal, ridiculed as 'FTAA lite', reflects gaping disagreements between the two economic titans of the Western Hemisphere over how far negotiations should go in dismantling trade barriers.  It would fall grievously short of the sweeping and comprehensive 'NAFTA on steroids' goal envisaged in 1994, when preparatory FTAA negotiations first began among all countries in the Western Hemisphere except Cuba. Trade watchers are increasingly suspicious that the United States' only aim in Miami is to keep talks alive until the meeting ends Nov. 21.
