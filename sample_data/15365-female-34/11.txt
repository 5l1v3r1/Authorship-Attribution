Kundalini Rizing   I am cross legged, spine growing, root to the ground; pushing it all towards the center and breathing deep light from below, from above, meets in the heart chakra up to the blue light shining,  lotus flower opening, growing, tickles like static electricity like the salt pepper atomic tv glow, chanelled, funneled up like a tube, suction, highcracking of stretching, straight then swaying  here, now.
