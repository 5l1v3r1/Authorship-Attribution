Survival Instinct   Mirrors crack, smashed to pieces, shards falling easily,  reflecting a face still used to control, eyes snapping up love  like a paper fan.  Someone is sad. Someone is unsure.  The fit is just not there yet.  There are many layers to digest  and unfold into words.  There are worlds waiting exploration, colors and lights and music, gumball bliss, graffiti sunsets, and the answer  we've all been waiting for, waving  from the next balcony over.
