Nicotine is the addicting chemical in all forms of tobacco. It is a very powerful and dangerous drug - a small child can die from eating just two cigarettes. Nicotine causes the release of brain chemicals, which can give a "high" similar to other addicting drugs. It may be as addicting as heroin. The body goes through a physical "withdrawal" when the nicotine level drops - causing the "nicotine fit."   Nicotine withdrawal can be very unpleasant - many smokers find it difficult to quit due to nicotine addiction. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, restlessness, craving nicotine, stomach problems, headaches and drowsiness. These symptoms must be addressed for most smokers to successfully become non-smokers.
