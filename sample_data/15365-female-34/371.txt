I'm getting ready to quit smoking. I woke up at 5 am with tremendous pain in my lungs. I think this cold I have is intensified by 18 years of sucking tar and chemicals into my body. Why is it so damn hard to quit? I read something that said to plan out a quit date. I haven't smoked today but my skin is starting to crawl with withdrawal. Should I plan out a quit date instead of quitting spur of the moment? Should I go buy my last pack of Basic Menthol Light 100s? Or have I already entered the non-smoking world?   urlLink Resources
