Cancer Horoscope (by Astrocenter.com)  Little voices are whispering in your ear today, and it could be that they are asking you to lift off the ground and join them in the clouds, dear Cancer. You might get the feeling that there is a great deal of tension between what your heart has to say versus what your mind has to say. Don't be surprised if the energy of the day leaves you in a muddle of confusion by the time the sun sets. Take deep breaths and don't stress about making hard decisions or commitments.
