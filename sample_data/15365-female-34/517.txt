Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front (excerpt)   Ask the questions that have no answers.  Invest in the millennium. Plant sequoias.  Say that your main crop is the forest  that you did not plant,  that you will not live to harvest. Say that the leaves are harvested  when they have rotted into the mold. Call that profit. Prophesy such returns.  Put your faith in the two inches of humus  that will build under the trees  every thousand years.   Listen to carrion -- put your ear  close, and hear the faint chattering  of the songs that are to come.  Expect the end of the world. Laugh.  Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful  though you have considered all the facts.  So long as women do not go cheap  for power, please women more than men. Ask yourself: Will this satisfy  a woman satisfied to bear a child?  Will this disturb the sleep  of a woman near to giving birth?   Go with your love to the fields.  Lie down in the shade. Rest your head  in her lap. Swear allegiance  to what is highest your thoughts. As soon as the generals and the politicos  can predict the motions of your mind,  lose it. Leave it as a sign  to mark the false trail, the way  you didn't go. Be like the fox  who makes more tracks than necessary,  some in the wrong direction.  Practice resurrection. ~ Wendell Berry   urlLink web version from panhala
