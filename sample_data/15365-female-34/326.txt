urlLink Poetry in Motion in Atlanta  Speech to the Young Speech to the Progress-Toward (Among Them Nora and Henry III)  Say to them, say to the down-keepers, the sun-slappers, the self-soilers, the harmony-hushers,  "Even if you are not ready for day it cannot always be night."  You will be right. For that is the hard home-run. Live not for battles won. Live not for the-end-of-the-song. Live in the along.  Gwendolyn Brooks (b. 1917)
