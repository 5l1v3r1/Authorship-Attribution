urlLink Daily Zen Meditation   Grace is within you; Grace is the Self. Grace is not something To be acquired from others. If it is external, it is useless. All that is necessary is to Know its existence in you. You are never out of Its operation.   - Ramana Maharshi ( d. 1950)  Goats: http://www.winterwindfarm.com/Goats.html
