Driver, Not Passenger    Overcome while driving, I call myself to leave a poem on my voice mail.  Calling in later to listen and take dictation, I realize I can't hear a damn thing but the open window,  now just a memory alongside road side stands, boiled peanuts, and a sign for the state prison,  saying to myself for the first time that forever  is just a word.
