Reverie   I'm not remembering my dreams just yet.   images of me at the shore taking off my necklace and holding it in the water   The morning wake up call and workout you see, it's all just so hectic.  My favorite thought at the beginning, "I'm walking amongst them," turns, and even I sour.  Still, I'm not quite dreaming, not even for three sustained days.  Sometimes I don't mind the drive.
