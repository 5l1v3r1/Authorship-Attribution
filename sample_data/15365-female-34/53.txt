THE SEEKER   She begins from the top of the skyscraper, a pageless freedom knowing only the path down.  Delicious, fingers type, controlling the speed of descent, a rapture, while God is sought  in guarded temples with the Guru, among bacon eating Buddhists saying Om, with the Universalists teaching of prey and predator, and Christians lighting candles to remember.  She is still searching; books at her side are titled "Awareness" or "Transformation" and she scolds herself for not remembering her breath.  She has centered herself between the extremes for now and January is cold.  A waning gibbous moon streaks the green outside like frost  and meditation  is found in the details.
