"The best advice I can give you is that you have to start trying different things.  You may start out pursuing a degree in rocket science and discover you love dissecting bugs in your biology class and then discover you like the cutting more than the bugs, and then you take a job as a butcher because you like to cut, and then you discover you like cutting meat in odd shapes and making sculptures out of glistening white beef fat, and then you discover that you have always wanted to do sculptures in marble, and then you discover you like making little marble chips most of all, and then at the end of your work life you buy a rock quarry and supply sand and gravel to contractors.   The best part of life is the ride and the adventures, victories, defeats, good, bad, happy, sad, love, and hate.  Remember in order to have something you have to know its antithesis.   In order to ride all that is necessary is to get on.  Life is the journey." Love...Dad
