"Bathrooms, hallway corners, laundry rooms, even open closets work well. Make sure your kitten can get inthe box easily; she may not be able to climb into the bathtub or over the high rim of a tall box.   One important piece of advice: Once you've decided on a spot, don't change it unless you are confident that boxes in other locations are already begin used frequently. Finally, keep track of which box is most popular -- you might be better off offering two in that spot, and foregoing the basement box that is visited only rarely."
