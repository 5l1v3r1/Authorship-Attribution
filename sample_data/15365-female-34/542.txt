urlLink Rare white buffalo born in Arizona :  "Things have been hopping lately at the Spirit Mountain Ranch, 20 miles north of Flagstaff on Highway 180. Three baby bison were born in five days, culminating in the birth of Sunrise Spirit, a full-white female Saturday. Two other bison, both reddish brown, were born earlier in the month. One male, Wind Dancer, was born during such strong winds that he could barely stand.   The birth of a white buffalo is very meaningful to many Native Americans, who hold that white buffalo are sacred and will return during a period of disaster in the world. Plains Lakota lore says the birth of a female white buffalo heralds a time of enlightenment and healing, bringing all races together in peace, balance and harmony."
