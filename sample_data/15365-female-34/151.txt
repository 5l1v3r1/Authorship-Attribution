About Aries (Ruler Mars):  The first sign of the zodiac has an aggressive self-assertive quality. Planets in Aries take on an initiating, fiery, and highly active disposition. When positively aspected Aries can be accomplishing, highly self-confident, and apt to draw a following due to the pronounced leadership abilities. When negatively aspected, planets here take on a selfish energy, one which acts too quickly and leaps into situations head-first without proper preparation. Aries is the first to get things started and can be combative when blocked or denied.  Sources:  urlLink Astrology for the Soul    urlLink Zodiac House
