FOR PHIL   You took a photo of me in stars, black back, and rain dripping down the screened porch.  You gave me comfort but I could not receive.  There were too many thoughts of goodbyes from others ringing in my ears for me to hear what you were saying.  I am surrounded by the aged and forget my youth from time to time.
