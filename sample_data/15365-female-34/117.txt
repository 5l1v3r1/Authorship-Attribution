TOO LATE   Not writing has become a metaphor for my life; instead of finished work behind me, ahead lies scraps of started interrupted thoughts, leading to what is unknown at present;  and I am behind myself, watching like talons underfoot tickle gashes, moving still under currents, thoughtless, running from something, giving up the dream again all too soon, again all too late to never finish the painting or poem.  What half am I trying so hard to whole with;  complete my self, male, female, animal;  and  planets spin and align, and astrologers interpret for the apathetic masses.  I shined too bright to be believable and when daybreak crashed against the bedroom wall, I was too hungry for the comfort and warmth of eyes and arms and legs to wrap around to tell the truth to even myself;  finding out too late, just as good as never finding out at all.
