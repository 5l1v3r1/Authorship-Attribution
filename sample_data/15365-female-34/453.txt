urlLink Llewellyn Journal - The Harmonic Concordance, a Time of Enlightenment and Letting Go : "Right now the world stands ready to receive a great spiritual gift from the universe. After the conflict and trouble of the last several years, staring with the Grand Cross in August 1999 and continuing with the Saturn/Pluto opposition of 2001, we are now being given a great reward. The November 8, 2003 Lunar Eclipse at 16 degrees of Taurus brings with it several positive, once in a lifetime aspects, brimming over with positive energy.  First, the eclipse itself is one of the best of the Saros series of eclipses. An eclipse series has a history behind it, bringing forth either positive or negative energy. This one is positive. All the best of Taurus energy is flowing in and around this eclipse. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and harmony. Taurus is concerned with the issues of relationships, money, real estate, beauty and the greenery of the earth. Taurus is the gardener of the zodiac, the one who plants her garden and then waits and watches it grow. Now is a great time to plant some seeds and wait for them to shoot up."
