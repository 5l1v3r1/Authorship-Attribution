LOOP   Expression of which is covered over begs for approval removal.  All your life you have known who you really are.  Sometimes it bubbles to the surface like translucence rainbowing in the sun.  Sometimes it pricks like a pebble  in an ice skate laced up tight, buried layers  deep down in the sock.  You never really cared  to own your own laughter or delight shared with others still fearing their own shadows, but La Ventana is open wide, proof enough that water can wear down the earth.  Wind too, can wash away the strongest stone.  Emanate and luminate past the stairs of wonder. Even the way down is up from here.  You are here on  temporary assignment on a fixed track, in the last car, approaching the final climb.  Throw your arms wide into the sky and squeal your way to the end.  You have an all day pass from here on out.
