urlLink QuitNet QuitGuide  Physical Addiction Within just 7-10 seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine begins affecting your brain.  Nicotine acts on cells in the reward center of the brain.  This results in feelings of pleasure and alertness- the "hit" that your body comes to expect.  When bloodstream nicotine levels are at their peak, the brain is highly stimulated.  However, within just 30 minutes, your body has cleaned out most of the nicotine.  You then feel tired, jittery, depressed, or fatigued.  You begin to crave another cigarette, and the cycle continues.  This cycle, which increases in intensity and frequency over time, is part of what makes cigarettes so addictive.   Essentially, smoking becomes a never-ending battle of trying to stay within the comfort zone.
