DISILLUSION MEANT   The moon plays tricks on my peace of mind and I am happily surprised by Pisces Balsamic curl of light.  Surprise is always happy.  Intentional change may present a few road blocks.  Tested and teased, I left my worries on the Bahamas  breeze, the sidewalk balcony outside my room with the mini golf view, and the buffet extravaganza.  The time to leave signals, a flash of lightening and the thunder is a smile.  Nine years passed without the pantyhose battle once brought into the open.  I wore flats and rose colored glasses in defiance of no one but myself in the end.  My reasons have changed but my soul has remained strong.  I have finally found the path I have been walking on all along.
