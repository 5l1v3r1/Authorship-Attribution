THIS WEEK'S HOROSOCOPE:  After being in Pisces for quite some time, Mars moves into Aries, and begins to stir up the area of your chart associated with your career. Things will begin to happen in this section for sure. After a time in which you probably felt stuck, or that all your efforts were producing very few results, you will certainly begin to see a difference. You will want to initiate some action, and get things moving after a period of having to wait.    Thank GOD! Finally I will be able to get on with it all and put an end to this limbo routine. Having a job again here I come!
