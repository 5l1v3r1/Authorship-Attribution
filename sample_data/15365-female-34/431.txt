Hey...this is a really handy tool.  urlLink ieSpell - Spell Checker add-on for Internet Explorer : "ieSpell is a free Internet Explorer browser extension that spell checks text input boxes on a webpage. It should come in particularly handy for users who do a lot of web-based text entry (e.g. web mails, forums, blogs, diaries). Plus you get to store and use your personal word list across all your applications, instead of maintaining separate ones on each application."
