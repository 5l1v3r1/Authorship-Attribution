urlLink Washing Machines : Washing machines should have at least three water level selections - high, medium and low; and provide for washing in cold, warm and hot water and rinsing in cold water. Other features should be selected on the type of washing that is expected. Some of these include delicate and permanent press cycles. In general, washing in warm water is the most energy efficient method; cold water washing usually requires a longer cycle or more detergent to wash the clothes to the same degree of cleanliness. Using the proper water level to fit the load is probably the most important energy saving consideration when operating a washing machine."
