THE REVIEW(S) IS/ARE IN   The words are out in print for comment or not, and the judgement is not guilty  for now.  Decision hangs steady for three days running with little deviation in the story line.  Simple fool to be nothing better than or just something overlooked again.  The wonder of it all and the knowing is like a path.  I stopped on the walk, dropped to my knees and counted, curled like a fist, waiting for the moment past passed.
