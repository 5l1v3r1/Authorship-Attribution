Nicotine is a Bitch Goddess   Half-crazed I plunder my home in search of a lighter;  settle on the stove.  I am smoking inside again. It's all those damn hotel stays, smoking room, king sized bed, and me alone, wretched, pathetic, covers pulled awry and feet hanging out,  thinking about bed fires.  Nicotine is a bitch goddess.  Ok, so it's true. I did start smoking to look cool; 15 and insecure, knowing I was different; wanting it to show more.  I laid down at her alter and bought my first pack of Dorals.  16 years later, I singe eyelashes over Basic menthol lights.  What is it about menthols anyway? Nobody ever wants to bum.  I would have been cooler getting Marlboro reds and packing them down;  tap, tap, tap.
