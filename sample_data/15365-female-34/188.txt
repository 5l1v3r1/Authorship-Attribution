urlLink By Brian Ogan, Designer : Accentuate tall, open spaces. Don't clutter walls with small pieces of art. A favorite tactic is to fill a large pot with river rocks and arrange tall bamboo stems that fan out and reach to the ceiling. An interesting sculpture also works well.   Warm up a wall. Paint a single wall in a soft sage or a warm wine. This adds a welcome touch of color and warmth.   Get smart about storage. Carefully plan every piece of furniture to control clutter. Open shelving is also a good option, because it keeps the wall exposed and maintains the open feeling of the room.    Use lighting as art.  Simple, modern wall sconces are attractive and provide soft illumination without using up valuable surface space.    Use area rugs as anchors. Area rugs help break down a loft space into separate living areas, without sacrificing overall openness. They also warm up bare floors and help reduce echoes.   Maintain open space. Arrange furniture so it does not block views to windows and doors. Modern benches, stools, and ottomans are great because their simple, clean lines don't obstruct views and minimize the feel of a small room. Coffee tables and lamp tables with clear glass will give you extra surface space but won't make a room look cluttered. Avoid overstuffed sofas and chairs.
