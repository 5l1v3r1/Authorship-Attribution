urlLink Researchers Fashion the First Single-Molecule Circuit   NANOTECHNOLOGY  Researchers Fashion the First Single-Molecule Circuit  In a remarkable feat of engineering, researchers at IBM have wired up a working computer circuit within a single carbon nanotube. Building on earlier work, Phaedon Avouris and colleagues turned the nanotubeessentially a sheet of carbon atoms rolled into a supertiny strawinto a voltage inverter, or NOT gate, one of the three fundamental types of logic gates on which all computers rely. The team presented its findings over the weekend at the 222nd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society and published a paper in the August 26 Web edition of ACS's journal, Nano Letters.
