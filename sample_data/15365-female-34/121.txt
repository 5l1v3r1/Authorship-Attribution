BACK FROM NOWHERE   For weeks the wind has been howling backwards, blowing not a leaf but the sound and  the rumble inside is like a passing train.  The whistle never blows here in this town too far from major arteries; still there are tracks to cross back and forth and  harder  on a bike.  And this is home now.  I keep reminding myself how happy I am to have so much shade again.  I keep reminding myself how lucky I am  to have found someone who will live with me and my faults, little lines that open up the earth with a crack to fill with water.  And I keep reminding myself that it's okay to live without forever, it was only a word anyway.  Nights like these, the distant traffic sounds from Waldo Road are as comforting  as any waves reaching the shore but I still strain to hear a few planes or the helicopter landing on Broward General or searching for crime.  It's small town life and my space  is smaller too.  I'm still learning to share. It's so much easier for me to give.  You are asleep now, resting for work and dreams I do not understand.  Sometimes I wonder  if we weren't closer apart.
