The Dining Room  Dining tables should not be placed in front of the main door.  A dining table that faces the toilet receives too much Yin and can negatively affect health.  A dining table should not be used as partition between two rooms.  If a dining table faces the kitchen or is in the kitchen area, it receives too much Yang and the diners might develop a bad temperament.  Air conditioning, central heating and fans are best kept on the left side of the dining room.
