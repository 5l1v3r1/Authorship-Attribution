urlLink Kundalini Poetry : SURVIVAL GUIDE (for Dan) by El Collie  You get through the ravages of Kundalini awakening the same way people from time immemorial survived all appointments with destiny (birth, irreparable loss, old age, death). You learn to tough it out. You learn to accept. You learn to surrender. You learn to lean into the arms of grace both unseen, from the realms above, and extended through a human hand. You get through tattered and torn around the edges. You get through wondering how you've managed to make it through this far. You get through hanging on for dear life. You get through shaken and shuddering and sheared of everything but your quivering mind and quaking heart, and the distant echo of a memory that this was why you came here. Though you think there has been some colossal mistake, inscrutably, incredibly, something in you knows that this is precisely what you came here so valiantly to endure: this merciless nakedness of heart and soul.
