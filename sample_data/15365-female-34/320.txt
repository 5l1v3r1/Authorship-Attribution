Alert: Total Lunar Eclipse Set Thursday  AP to My Yahoo!   LOS ANGELES - If the weather cooperates, a total lunar eclipse will be seen across North America late Thursday  the first visible in the United States in three years  and just before dawn Friday in western Europe and western and southern Africa.   A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth casts its shadow on the full moon, blocking the sunlight that otherwise reflects off the moon's surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye.   In North America, the moon will remain totally eclipsed for 53 minutes, and should turn substantially darker and reddish in color.   The total eclipse will start at 8:13 PDT in Los Angeles, 11:13 p.m. EDT in New York. A second lunar eclipse, on Nov. 8, will be visible from North and South America.   Eclipses once helped prove the Earth is round, because its shadow on the moon is curved.
