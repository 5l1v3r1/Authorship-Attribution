Today's Cancer Horoscope   by Astrocenter.com : Today, dear Cancer, is a day to separate the wheat from the chaff. Or, in other words, to take a good long look at your relationships and decide who is a true friend and who is not. You are very loyal, which is certainly to your credit. But what is the point of being loyal to people who do not return the courtesy? You have given your so-called friends more than enough opportunities to demonstrate their affection. As difficult as it may be for you, it is time to let these relationships fall by the wayside. Look at it this way: this will free you up to spend more time with your true friends.   by Tarot.com : The primary issue in your life comes back to a recurring theme. What do you feel in your gut? And how does this differ from what you need to do in order to maintain your own stability? Its a variation on the head versus heart stuff. The feelings are clearly telling you one thing, but logic pushes you in a slightly different direction.
