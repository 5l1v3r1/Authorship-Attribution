urlLink World Reacts with Revulsion to U.S. Attacks  LONDON (Reuters) - World leaders reacted with revulsion on Tuesday to what President George Bush called an ``apparent terrorist attack'' by aircraft that crashed into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon (news - web sites) in Washington. But amid the global horror, Palestinian gunmen at refugee camps in Lebanon fired into the air on Tuesday to celebrate the news of the attacks. ``America and Israel are one. This is the result of American policy,'' one Palestinian gunman said. No one had yet claimed responsibility. Lebanese, Palestinian and Israeli leaders joined Europe, Mexico and other countries in condemning the devastating attacks that caused as yet unknown casualties. Western European leaders broke off their normal business to return to their capitals for crisis meetings and expressed solidarity with the United States. From every corner of Europe, leaders condemned attacks they branded horrendous, abominable, disgusting, monstrous and abhorrent. The European Union (news - web sites) said it was the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor 60 years ago and was ``one of those few days in life that one can actually say will change everything.'' ``This is an act of war by madmen,'' EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten told Reuters. Norway called it the worst terrorist attack in history.
