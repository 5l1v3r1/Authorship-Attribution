urlLink newsobserver.com - A Buddhist view of peace :  Q - How do you reconcile material success with Buddhism? A - That's pretty easy because the founder of Buddhism was a great material success first. He was a prince. He was about to be crowned king in his country. And then he declined that responsibility and that role, that status, because he realized, having had those statuses, that in themselves, they don't make you any happier. And that there's a deeper way, and a more demanding way, to try to find a road to happiness.
