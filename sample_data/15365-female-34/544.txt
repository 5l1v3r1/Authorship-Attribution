urlLink the truth  ADVERTISING IDEA  I started smoking when I was 15. I am now 33 . I've made numerous attempts to quit smoking but at some point, maybe a day or a year later, I find myself at a convenience store or gas station buying cigarettes and getting hooked again. I always get a pack of matches for free along with the pack. My story is the same as tens of thousands of other smokers.   If you really want to make a difference, please start distributing your anti-smoking advertising on match books. A diseased lung on a pack of free matches would be a chilling image that could help get ex-smokers who fell off the wagon back on again.   Thank you!
