urlLink South Padre Island - Poetry : "Poetry Submission Guidelines THEME AND VARIATIONS is a weekly radio program which examines the interconnectedness of classic literature and classical music. Distributed by National Public Radio in some 65 markets in the U.S., the program combines dramatic readings of classic fiction with classical music on a similar theme (for instance, Prokofiev's opera War and Peace woven into readings from Tolstoy's novel). Once a month, however, we open up the program to new voices -- the music of today's finest working composers and the poetry of amateur and professional writers from around the world. The result is a unique one-hour music and poetry magazine which we think is one of the finest hours of radio entertainment going. "
