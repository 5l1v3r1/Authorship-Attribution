ONLY STARTS   In the in between,  between fear and flight,  choices breeze through chance, opportunities tease,  and  voices never echo the same through the open door,  closed by passers by.  Single light switch, socket, the pulsating electric puzzle, writhing like  tommorow;  procrastination finely tuned for the recital;  Mars coming closer to earth than what could mean something wrong.  The planets rarely align for despair or disasters yet to come.  More is wished into the energy vacuum than all the worlds pennies buying nothing these days.  Paint over the mess you thought you made with your life.  Pull off that protective vinyl cover.  The suits were made for flight and in the end, it's only starts.
