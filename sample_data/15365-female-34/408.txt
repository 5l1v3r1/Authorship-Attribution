The contemplation for this week is:  What is the key to self-trust? Self-acknowledgement, self-acknowledgment, self-acknowledgment. How would it affect your state if, each time you came through on a promise or duty or performed some beneficial action, you took the time to acknowledge yourself? What if you take a moment and thank yourself?   Become sensitive to the good things that you do, especially something out of the blue. Make it a constant practice to acknowledge yourself every time you come through.  -- Gurumayi Chidvilasananda
