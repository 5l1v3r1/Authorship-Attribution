Current Phase: New Moon  Well, this last moon cycle certainly brought with it some interesting events. There was an "in your face" quality to reality. Today kicks off the next moon cycle with a beginning in  Earth/Taurus . The new moon is often looked at as the dormant phase in a moon cycle where the seed really takes root. Sensible, strong-willed Taurus should provide safe and fertile ground. The earth element represents everything that has the potential for growth into something greater with a special focus on the tangible.  Go within to plant your intentions for this cycle. This one could be big.  Sources:  Moonsurfing   The Moon Oracle   Earthlore Astrology
