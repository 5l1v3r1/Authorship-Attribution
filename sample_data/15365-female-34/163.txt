CANCER LUNAR CYCLE  June 29 - July 27  from  urlLink http://www.moonsurfing.com/    The Cancer lunar cycle marks our entry into the 2nd quarter of the lunar year.   Tune into feelings and take decisive action to further your creative goals as the light and waxing energy increases.   Ideas and resources focused on in the first quarter of this lunar year will provide nourishment for the creative birthing that is to come.   This lunar energy engenders highly intuitive emotionally sensitive energy. Take advantage of opportunities to target and heal emotional stumbling blocks so you can manifest the reality you truly want.   Emotional and spiritual nourishment are emphasized. It's important that you manage this energy by taking care of your needs so they're not projected onto your relationships and the world at large.   Spend time at home to make it more comfortable and inviting for you and your family. Enjoy music, good food, relish your emotional connections, and soothe your soul with creative pursuits.   This lunar month ruled by the Moon reminds you that you can't draw from an empty well. Revisit and reclaim that which nurtures and nourishes you on the deepest levels.
