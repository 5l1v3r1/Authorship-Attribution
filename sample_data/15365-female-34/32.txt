When the Moment Strikes   Suddenly you are lifted from the fog,  and all around and inside  is now.  Almost without warning, the picture sharpens;  and even name badges carry hidden meaning.  The words that come out are flushed with heart beat;  some truth to utter,  practicing for the real job that has yet to come;  but sits so close now on the edge of the river,  dangling its toes in the water.
