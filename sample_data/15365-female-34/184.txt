Do not use a beater bar vac by all means. Even if the bristles are soft, it only takes one paperclip to get caught up in it to really mess up your floors. As far as wheels go, best not to do that either. No, I don't expect the appliance to float above the floor mysteriously, but a damaged plastic or a metal wheel can cause considerable damage in a short amount of time.   Expect higher maintainence on wood floors than carpet and expect to clean it more often. Carpet acts as a filter and absorbs dust and dirt. Wood can't. I have dark stained red oak (finish is tung oil) wood flooring thru out my home and have always used my dust mop (sometimes lightly mist dust mop with water) with my dustpan, then mop with warm water which mop is wrung out till almost dry/damp and then mop my floor. My mother lives in her old family home which was built in the 1870s and she always used a dust mop and never used a vacuum and her floors are beautiful!   Another good workable and cheap solution.... a small shop vac. I bought the 2Gal/2.0 HP sized one at Lowes for $29 and it sucks up everything (including the drapes). Also, for quick cleanups of pet hair balls and the like, I use the dry swifter mop.
