Human Rights  Dutch civil servants wed nearly 2,000 same-sex couples during the first six months after gay marriages were legalized in 2001, a government agency said Wednesday. The gay marriage law that took effect April 1 made the Netherlands the first country to grant gay couples the same rights as heterosexual couples, including the right to adopt children. The Central Bureau of Statistics said 2,100 men and 1,700 women had married someone of the same sex by September 30.
