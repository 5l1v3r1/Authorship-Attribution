FINISHED   That's it. I have had enough of trying to relate, to change the world, to change myself, to make a difference, to make a dent.  BOOM  Let hope explode.  BOOM  Fireworks of faith.  BOOM  There's nothing left. I have wasted my life living someone else's dream, someone else's expectations.  BOOM  I should be burned at the stake for treason.  BOOM  I should be nailed to the cross for my thoughts, kept inside again, repressed inside again, silent, useless, lonely, ugly, nothing golden bright to offer the universe.  BOOM  Time is running through my fingers and I don't have the answers, these dubloons are melted chocolate stale Easter leftovers, and I am going to hell anyway for tempting married men when I had none of my own, for speaking out too seldom, for dragging my kindness through the coals like it's nothing, like I am nothing to offer but down  while the wheels spin and the roar of the plane, and the polite way the passengers ignore eachother even when someone is screaming.
