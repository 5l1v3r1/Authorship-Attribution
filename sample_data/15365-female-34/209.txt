urlLink September 11, 2001   September 11 2001, the tone of America changed.  The news was relentless and none of it was good. Words conveyed the events but words failed to tell the emotional tale. As NPR covered the events, it was music that gave listeners time to reflect, to digest the images and the impact. So many letters came to NPR telling us how comforted they were by the music. In the wake of all that happened I was surprised anyone would take the time to mention the music; it seemed so trivial compared to the weeks' events. I was reminded again why composers score and why players perform. Together they create a magnificence that goes beyond the spoken word, both touching the ear and reaching the soul.   I've put together some of that music here, in part to answer some of those letters wondering what we played (precise record keeping was impossible), and also to create an aural snapshot that in some small way tries to capture the tone of a nation shaken and changed.  I hope you find comfort in this edition of All Songs Considered.  Bob Boilen Director All Things Considered
