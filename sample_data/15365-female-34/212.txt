urlLink From Embryo To Placenta, Gene Transfer In Primates A Success   MADISON - By successfully inserting a gene from a jellyfish into the fertilized eggs of rhesus monkeys, scientists have managed to make transgenic placentas, placentas where the inserted gene functions as it does in the jellyfish.   Writing today, Sept. 11, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Thaddeus G. Golos of the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, described the successful insertion of a "reporter gene" into two fertilized rhesus macaque embryos. The gene, which causes jellyfish cells to produce a robust green glow, likewise conferred this activity on the placental cells where it was found.
