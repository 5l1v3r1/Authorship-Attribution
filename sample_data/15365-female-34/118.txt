UNWRAPPED   Yesterday afternoon, we weeded  our first garden and  tilled the soil.  Now each  breath we take  is a greater symbol  than jumping  from a plane.  Your fingers touch mine and  the perfect fit of the palms together are more  than two breaths finding rhythm.  Each day more is unwrapped and contents  spill from morning, to afternoon, to evening.  I am below and above and beside it all, looking forward as if  it's the first time that direction  ever existed for me at all.
