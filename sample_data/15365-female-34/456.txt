"More servants wait on man than he'll take notice of. The private poor man hath cities, ships canals, bridges, built for him; he goes to the post-office, and the human race run on his errands; to the book-shop, and the human race reads and writes of all that happens for him; to the court-house, and nations repair his wrongs." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
