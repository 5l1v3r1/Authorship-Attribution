urlLink The Gospel According To Darkness - Siberry Jane  i know there's a place that you call your own  and you're safe and warm and you feel like you're home  and the peace of it and the faith involved  and you go to say...but there's no need to explain it  still you try then you see that it's okay. you're on your own   i see you lookin' around at the people on the street  well, things aren't what they seem.  if you push them hard enough  you'll find that most of them do not feel worthy of love  now how did this come to be?
