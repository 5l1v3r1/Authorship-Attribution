Total Lunar Eclipse and Happy Harmonic Concordance  From: "kelleyrosano"   "The Harmonic Concordance is a fantastic opportunity for all. Above all else, it is a time to be grounded, patient, and wise. Your life is never just one event.  Here are some questions to consider:   What would you dare to dream if you knew you could not fail?   Where does courage dwell in me?   What are my intentions? What are my heart's desires?  What negative or self-limiting beliefs can I clean out?   What would you like to have, do or be in 2004? What do you need right now to feel safe, balanced, focused, and secure?  What do you have in your life that you are grateful for? "
