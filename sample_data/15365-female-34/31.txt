My Real Job   It is frustrating, this waiting, this wondering about what exactly it is that I am supposed to be doing here  on this earth, in this house, with this life.  Sometimes, I cramp with shoulds;  the inside voices, huddled together, scheming over plans written in the past.  Sometimes, I burn with maybes;  lofty ideas about what a better person I might become.  I am seldom content with  the moment , unless in silence,  in meditation,  in contemplation and recognition that it is all I have.
