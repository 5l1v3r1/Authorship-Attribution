HEATHEN   These are not the keys I wanted to press 65 days in.  This is not the Sunday afterwards I wanted to spend with you.  I am a balloon that's been deflating for years.  Nobody said anything.  Isn't now too late to raise my hand for air?  This is not the song I expected to be playing for you this month.  This is not the book I wanted to read when I finally let go.  What makes you think you are so special?  What gives you the right to judge and complain?  I am a television series all to myself.  I want to tell my friends to stop right where they are and let me get this down on paper or where is that camera, tape recorder, something.  This is what I am supposed to remember.  Interesting is even better than saved.
