Wednesday afternoon and I am googling  urlLink holistic "cold sore"  .... would that be a good name for a band?    Seems the general consensus is to eat foods  urlLink high in lysine  and  urlLink zinc  or take supplements. Seems stress is the most typical cause. CNN has a  urlLink good article  about them.&nbsp; Still I wonder,  urlLink why does Pavel have a  cold  sore and why do I have a  canker  sore?
