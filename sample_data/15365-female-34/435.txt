Quit Tip: Your Body Is Healing Itself   Keep in mind that although withdrawal symptoms might be uncomfortable, they are normal, harmless and temporary. They're a sign that your body is healing and cleansing itself of the nicotine, tars, and other cigarette poisons, which have had you in their grip for a long time. Your whole system is returning to a normal state. Think of this as a positive process, as a sign that your body is recovering.
