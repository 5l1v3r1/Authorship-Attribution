Maestro   Stronger, your words as though in a flash;  all that you have been, suddenly brilliant, focused, honest, hiding nothing.  Each word, heart beating, pulsing at the lines, spilling, eyes closed, tingling inner,  breathing slower, harder, with each line stanza grouped together; each more powerful than  my last, combining in elements, lining up for the last word;  shot into nothingness, never waiting to stop spinning.
