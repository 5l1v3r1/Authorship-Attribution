ONLY IN DREAMS   Why must love be for another when it can not be against?  Last week I was your lover, wife, favorite friend, and child's mother.  You came to my door with words I long to hear, having scripted them so meticulously, missing nothing.  We spoke from the heart and dreamed in color, filling the skies, traveling through deserts and on high mountain roads.  I gave you the resume of my heart, objective clear, and you responded in delight.  Pity you were not there to experience any of it.  Why must love be for another when it can not be against?
