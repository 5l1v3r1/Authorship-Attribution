urlLink Current Phase: Full Moon in Aquarius   This Full Moon is in the sign of Aquarius, opposite the Sun in Leo. This polarity is symbolic of individual needs [Leo] vs. collective ones [Aquarius]; attachment vs. detachment; individuality vs. groupidentity. The challenge is to allow them to work together harmoniously. This can be tough, since emotional energy is usually quite heated around the Full Moon period, and many may be touchy and oversensitive. Give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and use the intensity of this lunation to focus on productive matters pertaining to your sign.  The Full Moon period signifies the peak of the waxing Moon energy... a great time to focus on spiritual, magical energies in order to direct them through meditation or personal ritual. Many also focus once again on the goals that were set at the previous New Moon, and utilize the intensity of the Full Moon to release their intentions to the Universe with gratitude and respect.
