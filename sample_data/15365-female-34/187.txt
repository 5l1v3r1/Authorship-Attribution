urlLink Whirlpool Resource Saver Washer  The innovative Whirlpool Resource Saver® Washer saves up to 47% of the water needed to clean clothes, while using only 56% of the energy*. This could save you up to $100 per year.   urlLink Senseon Dryer  The Senseon™ Drying System uses a thermistor and moisture-sensing strips, coupled with computer controls, to continually measure temperature and moisture to determine the load type and rate of drying. When clothes reach "damp dry", the dryer already "knows" how long it will take them to be completely dry because it knows the types of clothes being dried (whether they're heavy or light) and how long it took them to reach the damp dry point. This accuracy helps prevent overdrying and shortens cycle times by up to 20 minutes.
