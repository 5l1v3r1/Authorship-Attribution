DAYLIGHT SAVINGS   Fire does not sit well with me alone in this room still  and sweat is hanging like a heavy too big to hold child  in this room humid airless  and I could go open the windows  and I could turn on the air  but no and not and suffer this martyr I am not satisfied with all of my choice with all of my everything told I can do whatever I want as wanting makes  as desire fufills  as comfort shields my eyes I see nothing but blind  as routine paves my sidewalk I feel nothing under foot  as more advice to stay to not risk to not dare or dream or trust or live  all of the voices stop I have heard all the words from inside before  and this is just another hole and it's for me to decide something new and not worry about right
