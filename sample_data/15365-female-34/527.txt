Introductions   Some of what we love  we stumble upon -  a purse of gold thrown on the road,  a poem, a friend, a great song.   And more  discloses itself to us -  a well among green hazels,  a nut thicket -  when we are worn out searching  for something quite different.   And more  comes to us, carried  as carefully  as a bright cup of water,  as new bread.  ~ Moya Cannon (The Parchment Boat, 1997)
