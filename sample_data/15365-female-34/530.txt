Repair & Maintenance >> Wheels >> Tire & Tube >> urlLink How to Fix a Flat Bike Tire   Remove the wheel from the bike.  Remove one side of the tire from the rim.  Find the leak in the tube, and check the corresponding area of the tire for glass, thorns, or other debris.  You should also check the rim for sharp edges that may cause flat tires.  Remove the old tube.  Inflate the new tube slightly. (Just enough to give it shape.)  Put the new tube inside the tire and insert the valve into the valve hole of the rim.  Mount the other side of the tire on the rim. It is best to only use your thumbs, but you may need to use tire levers.  Partially inflate the tire and check that the bead is evenly seated around the rim.  Inflate the tire to recommended pressure.  Put the wheel back on the bike and ride.
