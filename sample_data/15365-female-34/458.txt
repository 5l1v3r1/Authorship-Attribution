urlLink No-Thought for the Day  "The mystery never ends, it cannot end. Thats why it is called a mystery, it cannot be known ever. It will never become knowledge, thats why it is called a mystery; something in it is eternally elusive. And thats the whole joy of life. The great splendor of life is that it keeps you eternally engaged, searching, exploring. Life is exploration, life is adventure. "
