In Due Time   Fantasies of writing again push me to discuss the option.  My life coach tells me this is valueless,  who benefits from a poet anyway,  a few friends and maybe family who reads it and says,  "Oh, this is good" or "Interesting, hmm" or maybe says nothing at all.  You can't make money he reminds, and so then there is a lot of suffering.   his monthly check suffering too   And so I ask is a poet that self-indulgent and are they as bad as Matt Groening says in Life in Hell?  Almost mime status?  Fuck it. I have something to say. I'm not writing for you anyway. It comes because it comes  and if I don't let it out, I have no way of  remembering who I am;  and if I don't let it out, I grow ever inward, silent, shamed.  Far better to committ to three pages a day, and learn about myself by reading.  In due time, more will come.
