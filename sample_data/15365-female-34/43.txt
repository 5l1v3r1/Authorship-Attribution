Fort Lauderdale   Not ready to go back just yet; the stillness,  outside cool air; a smoke on the patio; the cats asleep peaceful vibe.  Dreaming of my Virgo man, who has not yet shown himself to me.  Maybe he is waiting inside a coffeehouse books on table, notepad caputuring the spill;  or traveling the world, taking notes.  The breeze through the window, South Florida autumn, brings the first clear air of seasons through my screen.  Soft cloth to the outside glass, let the sun shine warm this room.  Curtains back, parrots in the sky, another cafe con leche, por favor.
