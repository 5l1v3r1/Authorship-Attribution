urlLink News - US post-war effort seen as on the brink of "fiasco"  "It's close to a fiasco," said Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a Washington research organization.   "The contrasts between the efforts to rebuild Iraq and the stunning military victory could hardly be more pronounced."   Rejecting criticism that the United States failed to prepare for the post-war occupation, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has suggested that no plan could have anticipated the conditions confronting US forces.   "You couldn't know how it would end," Rumsfeld said in an interview with The New York Times published Sunday.
