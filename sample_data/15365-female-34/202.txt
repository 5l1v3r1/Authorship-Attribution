urlLink Test Links Brain Cells With Silicon Chips   From the Washington Post  Scientists for the first time have linked multiple brain cells with silicon chips to create a part-mechanical, part-living electronic circuit, according to a report in today's issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.  To construct the partially living electronic circuit, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Germany affixed multiple snail neurons onto tiny transistor chips and demonstrated that the cells communicated with each other and with the chips.  The advance is an important step toward a goal that is still more science fiction than science: to develop artificial retinas or prosthetic limbs that are extensions of the human nervous system.
