The contemplation for this week is: "The Sanskrit word for trust is visvas, which means breathe easy. When you find yourself complaining, My tolerance is growing thin, take a moment and be with yourself. Feel your nervous system, breathe easy, and delight in the fullness of the heart. Breathe easy. Visvas. Visvas means breathe easy. Breathe easy, freely, and naturally. Allow yourself to be tolerant in trust. Breathing easy gives patience. Breathing easy gives you access to your core strength. Breathing easy produces stability." -- Gurumayi Chidvilasananda
