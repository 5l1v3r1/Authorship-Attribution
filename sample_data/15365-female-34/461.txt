urlLink The Holy Light : "Inside the Holy Sepulchre the Patriarch prays kneeling and reading the special wishes requesting our Lord Jesus Christ to send His Holy Light as a gift of sanctification for the people. And in the absolute quietness at the hour when the patriarch prays a wheeze is heard and almost simultaneously blue and white lightnings of Holy Light penetrate from everywhere, as though millions of photographic flashes turn on embracing the walls and all the lamps light up miraculously. In the Holy Sepulchre the torches the Patriarch holds while he prays turn on also by the Holy Light. The crowd bursts out in cheers while teardrops of joy and faith run from the eyes of the people.  For a few minutes the Holy Light doesnt have the attributes of fire. This happens the first minutes after the patriarch comes out of the Holy Sepulchre and gives the Light to the people. Anyone can touch the fire of the 33 candles and he doesnt burn. After 33 minutes the flame is normal."   urlLink Telegraph | News | Holy Fire sets Orthodox rivalry ablaze in Jerusalem : Seems like a more cynical perspective.   urlLink Hvidt: The Miracle of the Holy Fire in Jerusalem : The miracle occurs every year on the Orthodox Easter Saturday.
