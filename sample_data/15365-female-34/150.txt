Current Phase: First Quarter in Capricorn  The Moon is the First Quarter Moon when it separates from the Sun (after a New Moon) at an angle of 90 degrees (square). This square (which looks like a half moon in the sky) asks us to take care of the small things that grow into big uncomfortable things. If tensions come up, it's because you need to look at some part of a relationship or emotional structure in your daily life that just isn't working right and may need more thought. The First Quarter Moon is the first aspect since the New Moon that asks us to look at our newly devised plans from a distance that gives us a first glimpse of objectivity. This can create a sensitive issue or it can give you the resolve necessary to make improvements and keep going.    Capricorn Traits:  Capricornians are ambitious, resolute, cold minded, melancholic. Fatigue never makes them afraid, they work hard and are ready to sacrifice themselves, if necessary. They plan patiently and carefully all their objectives and the way to reach them. To achieve their results they are ready to do anything, without asking any help. They are reserved and introverted, but sometimes they live sudden moments of impulsiveness. Their main characteristics are shyness and insecurity which disappear when they realize of being loved and appreciated.  Sources:  urlLink ArtCharts    urlLink RealMagick
