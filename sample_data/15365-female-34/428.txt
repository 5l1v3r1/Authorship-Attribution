urlLink Jane Siberry - Calling All Angels Lyrics :  Santa Maria, Santa Teresa, Santa Anna, Santa Susannah  Santa Cecilia, Santa Copelia, Santa Dominica, Mary Angelica  Frater Achad, Frater Pietro, Julianus, Petronella  Santa, Santos, Miroslaw, Vladimir  and all the rest   a man is placed upon the steps, a baby cries  and high above the church bells start to ring  and as the heaviness the body  oh the heaviness settles in  somewhere you can hear a mother sing   then it's one foot then the other  as you step out onto the road  how much weight? how much weight?  then it's how long? and how far?  and how many times before it's too late?   calling all angels  calling all angels  walk me through this one  don't leave me alone  calling all angels  calling all angels  we're cryin' and we're hurtin'  and we're not sure why...   and every day you gaze upon the sunset  with such love and intensity  why it's...it's almost as if  if you could only crack the code  then you'd finally understand what this all means   but if you could...do you think you would  trade it in  all the pain and suffering?  ah, but then you'd miss  the beauty of the light upon this earth  and the sweetness of the leaving   calling all angels  calling all angels  walk me through this one  don't leave me alone  callin' all angels  callin' all angels  we're tryin'  we're hopin'  we're hurtin'  we're lovin'  we're cryin'  we're callin'  'cause we're not sure how this goes
