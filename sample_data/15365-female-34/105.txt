WAVE PARTICLES   Tired of sustaining the illusion, she cracks another whip and the music resumes,  Lonlied by me, my and mine, she parts the waves  to bring the boats to shore a prettier face  could have launched into battle.  The night slides into tomorrow, skids past midnight, then thud.  A few pieces are still missing from next week.  Destiny calls and a few are left on hold for way too long.  Apologies inner tube down the river in tank tops and flip flops.  The window of opportunity was dangled before the point of no return and all of the crickets left for better acoustics someplace else.  So what to stay and retrieve... the soul.  So what to stay and believe... the soul.   Nothing matters more than (fill in the blank) filtered through sand.
