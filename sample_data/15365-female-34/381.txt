urlLink Regularly Scheduled Programs : Satsang: Saturdays, 7:30 - 9:00 PM "Satsang means 'the company of the Truth.' These programs include chanting and meditation, and may also include readings and speakers sharing their experiences of Siddha Yoga. Each Satsang program helps us to include the teachings of Siddha Yoga in our daily lives."  I went to the program tonight and really enjoyed it. The people there are all so nice and seem so happy and at peace. They showed Gurumayi's videotaped lectures and she had really beautiful messages and stories to share.  I am still admittedly confused by the guru idea, maybe because there seem to be so many out there. This is my first experience with a guru. I feel connected to the energy. I don't see why I would look for another. I like the idea of a woman at the helm of about anything. Not something the other religions seem to groove on...
