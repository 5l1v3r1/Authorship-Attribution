WRITING   Always arriving like an itch nothing can scratch;  not mind, nor hopes, nor mindless cleaning, straightening for the the creation that comes from fingertips,  The night is longer still ahead of me, like wine, like water from glasses played for an audience;  different levels of liquid to appoximate the voice or a guitar left playing by itself, fingers strumming with nobody to hold the instrument.
