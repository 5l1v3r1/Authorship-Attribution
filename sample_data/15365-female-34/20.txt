Skort   When I was younger, it was my "whore heels," as Daniel was fond of saying.  Tight and black with thick wooden heels, the shoes and me, were captured on film,  only 22 years young.  Older now, I rise in my skort,  small and beige, $5.00 off the sale rack at Macy's,  and I am as strong as I was the lost night in Weston,  singing along with the radio on my way to get smokes.
