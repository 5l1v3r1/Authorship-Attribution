"Freedom refers to a social relationship among people- namely, the absence of force as a prospective instrument of decision making.  Freedom is reduced whenever a decision is made under threat of force, whether or not force actually materializes or is evident in retrospect." - omas Sowell {American Economist & Philosopher}
