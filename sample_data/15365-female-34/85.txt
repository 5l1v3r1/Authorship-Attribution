VIGIL   There are moments when joy doesn't come and all of the talk of God and peace does not fit the hole.  Even faith in the internet shatters under search terms not found.  The emptiness is vast without content.  The void is highlighted in gold and  over and over again outside it sounds like thunder or the sound of trash cans rolled out for the night, planning for the morning when time stands on end, static electricity in hair, the gong sounds.  Time's up.
