GUSTS   Another wind blows me into the tunnel; the concrete pipe kids crawl in and out of, but I stayed.  I claimed the walls as my own still refusing birth.  Inside, I asked the others to tell me the truth and they did.  They were too slow to come up with any questions for me and nobody could match my hours of practice asking questions into the void, the abyss that fed me mother's milk while I scrawled marks on the walls to measure time.  It's all here, all of my secrets revealed again, and if I forget another time then yes, again, I will seal the capsule with packing tape one more time and cast my bottle into the sea.  written 8/4/03 3:53 am
