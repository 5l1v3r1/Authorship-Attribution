DETACHMENT   My mother was right. The bone isn't stronger at the place of the break.  I remember this as I listen for the sound of your car turning back.  I have been listening for for 13 years  and you never come.  This time is no different. Your goodbye leaves me  scattered pieces this heart I mended, I tended so carefully these past four months with papers signed.  And tears come like air and sobs are hard like the sprinter's gasp and I find no peace, no deep waters under this shaken surface.  So alone, and you refuse my love again and again.  I know you don't love me. I felt it for six years, the unsurmountable task of communication.  We could find no network that could bring us together, no cables long enough or strong enough to channel the feelings.  And again and again I wait to hear what you can not say.  Maybe you think in your silence you do not hurt my feelings  as much as if I were to hear the truth.  Why is it like this between us?  You are the only man  whose love I have ever  wanted to have.  Time means nothing if it can still hurt just as much now.
