Alice is walking in a woods. She comes to a fork in the road. Not knowing which way to go, she asks the Cheshire Cat:  Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?  That depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the cat.  I dont much care where, said Alice.  Then it doesnt matter, said the cat.
