GROWING WINGS   Like an outpouring from the void, not even knowing what will be said next, it all comes together in a chorus of what to dos.  The eternal question of being strong enough for someone else too, you ask without a question mark.  There is always fear of never being enough for these mistakes offered up like proof.  I have not turned the air conditioner on since I have been home, a someplace I have been before, which surrounds me like a fog that does not come up through the trees at seven o'clock in the morning.
