Tell Ghana: Enforce Anti-Slavery Laws   Five thousand women and children live as Trokosi slaves in Ghana.  Trokosi, in the Ewe language, means wife of the gods.  According to a religious tradition called ju-ju, virgin daughters must be offered to fetish priests as atonement for the sins of family members or the gods will bring misfortune or even death upon them.  In 1998, the Ghanaian parliament amended legislation to ban the practice of Trokosi and strengthen punishment for offenders; however, they have done little to enforce the law.  Join us in pressuring the Ghanaian government to end Trokosi enslavement now!   urlLink Take Action!
