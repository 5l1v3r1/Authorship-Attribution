urlLink Internet Archive: Wayback Machine : Maybe I can use this to help recover some of the web pages I have lost due to whizhost leaving 86,000 without their web sites. How could people do this? All my data is lost. But life goes on. I just need to find a new web host, that's all. Starting over is not that bad. My web site was a mess of stuff anyway. Now maybe I can do something with a purpose. First there was memebeing.com, then moonpages.com, and now (soon anyway) it will be meaningfulpursuit.com. I'm ready.
