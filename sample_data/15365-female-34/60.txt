DISJOINTED   Who am I to tell you to stay and master the infinite complexities of unknown now  when power struggles weigh heavy on the scales shucked off with a borrowed knife and shining in the early light like rainbow fingernails  the missing piece is always missing or it would not be a piece  there are no stand alones or one offs or this or that creation to believe in something better different new  dreams are analyzed and shown on television for the masses wanting reality when truth does not connect them  soft edges the day at home incapable of being the listener to act alone  what purpose vision or adjustment or rain from these clouds heavy and boxes stacked like waiting for something grander or a kick in the ass never coming from one's own foot
