urlLink BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Moon colony 'within 20 years'  By Helen Briggs  BBC News Online science reporter    Humans could be living on the Moon within 20 years, says a leading lunar scientist. However, political will is needed to inspire the public to support the initiative.   "We believe that technologically it's possible," the project scientist on Europe's first Moon mission, Smart-1, told BBC News Online.   "But it will depend in the end on the political will to go and establish a human base for preparing for colonisation of the Moon or to be used as a refuge for the human species."   "To actually live on another world would be quite a test of technology as well as human physiology. We don't know what the long-term effects of living in a low gravity environment would be."
