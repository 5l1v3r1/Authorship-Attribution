Thank you for your inquiry regarding natural gas service---  It sounds as if you are familiar with gas appliances so I'll address the last part of your correspondence first---We do have an allowance of $50 for gas dryers if converting from electric to gas---However, this allowance does require that you have an existing gas water heater or install a gas water heater at the same time the dryer is installed (the latter would qualify you for an additional allowance)---For details please see our allowances and requirements which are also on our web site---  As you are probably aware, natural gas appliances are generally more cost effective (operationally) than comparable electric models, especially when combined with multiple pieces of gas equipment---  For information regarding the efficiency ratings of specific washers and dryers, please contact Amy Carpus in our Conservation Services Department @ 393-1450 with the make and model #'s of the units you are interested in and she will be able to assist you---  Thank you again for your inquiry and for using our online service---If you have additional questions regarding natural gas, please do not hesitate to contact me---  Mike Brown Gainesville Regional Utilities
