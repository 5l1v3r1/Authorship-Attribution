CLOSER UP   To whom may you sacrifice your needs to prove?  For whom do you toil and ponder nights spent awake, easing the way for dawn?  Letting go these images, the after burn of dreams, edges petal crisp, pixilated closer up, eat dot made from another pattern.  Whose timeline serves you best? Have you chosen your master well? Do you seek another's hands on your will?  The time will not come  for you to ask  these questions again, in this way, or with this urgency of command.  Relinquish the lust for results, acknowledging the answers given you didn't ask for.  Nothing can slip through fingers, even held tight, like impatience when a tunnel is bored into the earth or the flesh for a break through centuries overdrawn.
