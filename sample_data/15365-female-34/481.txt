The Road   Here is the road: the light comes and goes then returns again. Be gentle with your fellow travelers as they move through the world of stone and stars whirling with you yet every one alone. The road waits.  Do not ask questions but when it invites you to dance at daybreak, say yes. Each step is the journey; a single note the song.  ~ Arlene Gay Levine    urlLink     Click to subscribe to Panhala
