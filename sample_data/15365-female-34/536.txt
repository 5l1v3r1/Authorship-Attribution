BEGIN  This is now.  Now is, all there is.  Don't wait for Then; strike the spark, light the fire.  Sit at the Beloved's table, feast with gusto, drink your fill  then dance the way branches of jasmine and cypress dance in a spring wind.  The green earth is your cloth; tailor your robe with dignity and grace.  ~ Rumi
