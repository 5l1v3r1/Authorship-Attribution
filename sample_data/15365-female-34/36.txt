Some Goddess   You said that, "I inspire you."  And I gushed, girly, giggly, as expected by law;  a law that states a woman could hope for nothing better  but to be muse for some man.  Listen, hon. Epiphanies are not for barter. I offer you nothing in trade.  You chose your muse long ago  (and it comes in a can.)   Don't misunderstand me. I judge no one.  You chose your muse before I was even born;  and  perhaps a lesson for me  is to get off my ass and choose my own;  having learned in the end that love and working for the man ain't gonna cut it.  I have nothing to say, pissed again that the last milepost was just another damn cliche.
