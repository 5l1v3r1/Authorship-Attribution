urlLink Maya del Mar's Free Daily Success Guide Astrological Forecast : "SUNDAY NOVEMBER 23. The New Moon Solar Eclipse at 2 Sagittarius occurs at 4:02 p.m. The Sagittarius moon cycle is about moving into the world, spreading the word, letting the world know the truth of the matter and what we are about. In Scorpio we went through the dark tunnel of initiation. Now in Sagittarius we emerge into the bright sunlight, spread our wings, and fly. We feel reborn, and the world is our oyster. We want to announce it to one and all.  Sun and Moon's last contacts were their squares with Uranus, and they come into this fresh world with a great deal of independence. This eclipse will renew our autonomy, both personally and in the world. Uranus can also indicate surprises, and in Washington DC it is exactly overhead.  Mars is still jazzed up from its opposition to adventurous Jupiter, and it's now building up to a very assertive square with Pluto on Wednesday. At the same time, during the 48 hours from last night through tomorrow night, both Mercury and Moon square Mars and conjoin Pluto to fill our hearts and minds with aggressive vibes.  This is a dangerous time. A solar eclipse hides consciousness and allows the unconscious to rule. Sagittarius is the sign of the gambler. And aggressive Mars/Pluto impulses are raining into our head and heart, represented by Mercury and Moon.  Moon not only transits over Mercury tomorrow night; but it also eclipses Mercury, thus blotting out logic, and giving Mercury extra significance. Mercury adds to the already-strong movement and travel urges of this time.  Sagittarius is expansive. It is a no-holds-barred sign, always ready to go. It is very helpful now to have a plan of action, as a channel for the energy which is being released.
