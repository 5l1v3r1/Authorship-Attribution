urlLink New York Post Online Edition: horoscope : Your Horoscope for July 9, 2004  IF TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: You are determined to push yourself well beyond your normal limits this year - and no doubt you will succeed at whatever you decide to do. However, try not to forget that those limits are there for a purpose, and while it is good to test yourself every once in a while, if you keep pushing yourself for too long, you risk depleting your reserves of energy. Save yourself for the tests that truly matter.
