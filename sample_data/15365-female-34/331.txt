urlLink weather.com : More severe weather ahead  Sun, May. 04, 2003 9:45 PM ET   Tom Moore, Sr. Meteorologist    Midwest   A number of destructive tornadoes ravaged parts of the Plains and Midwest on Sunday. Tornadoes were reported from South Dakota to Oklahoma. The Kansas City metro area was particularly hard hit. At least one fatality was reported in Kansas City while areas to the northwest of town suffered extensive property damage. Severe weather will translate eastward overnight with more hail, damaging winds and possible tornadoes.   I am talking with Phil on his cell phone and he says the skies are really black. He loves severe weather and is enjoying the storms.
