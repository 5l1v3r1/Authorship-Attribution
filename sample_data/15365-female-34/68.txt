RSVP   Busting out a tickle pins and needles inside below the rib cage  the urge is so strong to live to create to be become feel free  liberated at last  something unknown magnetic tractor beam pulling me towards the next step  life mapped out and the bread crumbs eaten by forest animals  body draped on the massage table while my neck is pulled and pushed left center right  scolded for wearing my shoulders around my neck and the woman's pecs forgotten  hunching over from too much keyboard caressing  my fingers begin to curl  until at last reminded  death does not have to come by invitation
