urlLink About - StoryCorps : "StoryCorps is a national project to instruct and inspire people to record each others' stories in sound.  We're here to help you interview your grandmother, your uncle, the lady who's worked at the luncheonette down the block for as long as you can rememberanyone whose story you want to hear and preserve.   To start, we'll be building soundproof recording booths across the country, called StoryBooths. Our first one opens in Grand Central Terminal in New York City on October 23, 2003. You can use these StoryBooths to record broadcast-quality interviews with the help of a trained facilitator.  We've tried to make the experience as simple as possible. We'll help you figure out what questions to ask. We'll handle all the technical aspects of the recording. At the end of the hour-long session, you'll get a copy of your interview on CD. And thanks to the generous contributions of our supporters, all this costs only $10.  Since we want to make sure your story lives on for generations to come, we'll also add your interview to the StoryCorps Archive, housed at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, which we hope will become nothing less than an oral history of America. (See the press release on the Library of Congress Web site.)"
