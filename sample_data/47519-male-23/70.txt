Well, I've got a mouse in my house...  urlLink Abell Pest Control  was just by to bait my house. A few live bait traps and they also gave me some weird sticky paper, I guess it's kind of like fly paper for mice. I hope the traps work and I don't end up catching a mouse on this paper. I don't know what I'd do with it, though it likely wouldn't be what I'm supposed to: "just take it downstairs, roll up the paper and  stomp on it  and throw it in the garbage." I hope I didn't go too pale when the Abell guy said that...
