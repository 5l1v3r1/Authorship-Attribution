If anyone knows what music is used in the  urlLink Leggsy  "Supersub" ad, please  urlLink email me ! It's also used in Bend it like Beckham, but it isn't on the soundtrack...  In other music/movie news, Kill Bill is my favourite movie as of now. I bought the soundtrack for the song "Battle Without Honour or Humanity". It's so wonderfully cheesy. I also saw Bulletproof Monk. That is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Like Lord of the Rings the animated version badness. In fact it's so bad I'd recommend seeing it just so you know I'm not lying.  Anyhow, off to book some plane tickets!
