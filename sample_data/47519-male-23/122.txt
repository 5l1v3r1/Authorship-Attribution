Seriously, I'm 23 freaking years old, I should not be saying "What's the matter with kids today?", but what the hell... What's the matter with kids today? I like the fireworks for what they are, but I hate the crowd they attract. SkyTrain was full of rowdies, downtown is full of rowdies and I stopped at Subway to eat my dinner only to realise the rowdies were stopping there to go to the washroom. When they realised the washroom was full, they just urinated on the walls. INSIDE the restaurant. No crap.  I seriously hope rowdy, belligerent children running around getting wasted tonight either end up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning, the drunk tank or get beat by cops with night-sticks or shot with a taser or something. With any luck they'd be electrocuted to death. Disgusting little maggots.
