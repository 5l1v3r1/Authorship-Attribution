Went and saw Arthur last night. Unfortunately, came out a little disappointed. I have to agree with Jen, it's like they took the names of the characters in the legend and put them in a totally different story. Not a bad mindless action movie though. I definetly want to go see The Bourne Supremacy next weekend.
