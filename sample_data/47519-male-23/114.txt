You have GOT to be kidding me. System Requirements for the new Microsoft Operating System code named Longhorn. These are just the requirements to run the OS! JUST THE OS!   Microsoft is expected to recommend that the "average" Longhorn PC feature a dual-core [64-bit] CPU running at 4 to 6GHz; a minimum of 2 gigs of RAM; up to a terabyte of storage; a 1 Gbit, built-in, Ethernet-wired port and an 802.11g wireless link; and a graphics processor that runs three times faster than those on the market today.   Insane.  Pulled from  urlLink here .
