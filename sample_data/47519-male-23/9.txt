Well, got told off for walking down the street eating ice cream. Some bum figured they'd tell me I'm an asshole for eating ice cream and not giving them the change that I used to buy said ice cream. I just about fucking lost it. I didn't say anything for fear of flipping out and having them freak out more and end up drop-kicking them in the chin... The nerve though. I really don't bloody care if you're homeless. Call me hartless, but seriously: after a long week at work, putting in some OT and long commutes on public transit, I can't deal with people telling me that I owe them the money that I work so hard to earn, when all they do is sit on their ass all day...  On a slightly different note, this webpage looked like shite in Safari. Just saw it over at Ryan's place, hence the switch to the seriously minimal layout. I actually like it better though.
