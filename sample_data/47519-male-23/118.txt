Yeah, so I've already switched templates. I think I like the simple ones better.  So went out to see The Panic last night. They rocked the Railway Club. It was pretty strange though, as 3/4 of my old employers  urlLink Lightroom  were there. I didn't see if they recognized me or not. not that I care.
