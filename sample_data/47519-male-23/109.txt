So, I realise that I'm a bit of a technophile. I can't get enough of technology. Curiously though, it's lo-tech stuff that I love. I'm going through a bit of a phase right now where I'd love nothing more than to just pick up an old PowerBook Duo 2300c or PowerBook 2400, an old copy of Quark and Photoshop, and just make icons and pixel fonts and upload them to a sparse webpage. That's not saying there's not a place for high-tech stuff, I'd also love a 15-inch Aluminium PowerBook and Adobe CS, which would likely bring in more cash, but I'm lovin the lo-tech stuff.  On a high-tech note, I see Nintendo is kicking ass and taking names with the new Zelda. See  urlLink IGN  for details.
