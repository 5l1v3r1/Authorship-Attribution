Haha, two days and already I'm rethinking the format of what I want to do! Ah well, that's the way things go with personal websites right? Always under constant change... I'll still post song lyrics every now and again, but I think I can better represent myself by actually speaking my mind. Songs can represent so much, but sometimes it's only one or two lines that mean anything.  So I went to see Alien: The Director's Cut today. Never seen any Alien movies before in my life. Not actually as scary as I figured it would be, but a good movie none the less.
