Figures. Go to bed fucking early because I need to get up at 7:00am for curling. So why the hell am I posting this at twenty after one in the morning? Because the assholes two doors down from me are having a blazing row. Much swearing, yelling and smashing of dishes. Guy goes to leave, not the guy who lives there, must be his partner. Yelling in hallway begins. Am now wide awake. Take frustrated piss. Elevator opens, pounding on doors start, buddy has come back to scream more. Am too frustrated to care, open door: "Hey, do you mind keeping it down a bit? There are other people in this building, I have to get up early and you've woken me up." "Mind your own fucking business, asshole." Words aggrivated assult pop into my mind. Resist said urge. Calmly close the door and call 911 to report domestic disturbance. Am second complaint, police will be here soon. Will enjoy gawping out the door at them. Then sleep... Am walking zombie right now...
