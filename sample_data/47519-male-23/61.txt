Witnessed an accident last night. Thank God noone was hurt, it was pretty bad. Everyone was stupid, driver A was beyond speeding, driver B doesn't shoulder check and attempts to pull a U-turn from his parking space at the side of the road. Talk about T-Bone... I think in the eyes of ICBC, driver B will be at fault. In my eyes though, theres no excusing driver A for shouting and yelling and swearing and threatening and screaming racial slurs... I think that's just uncalled for. Sure you can be angry, but when buddy has his wife and three kids with him that just makes it worse when you call them all: "Stupid motherf**king ch**ks". Jerk.
