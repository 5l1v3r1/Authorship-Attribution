So, forgot to write about nearly having a new life experience on Thursday evening. Coming home from work, and I've decided to walk down Granville to Davie, and then up Davie in the alley through the back. As I've unlocked the gate and started to walk down the path, nothing is out of the ordinary. Now if you've been through the back of my apartment complex, you know that the pathway is below the level of the grass, and there's a bit of a corner where part of the grass protrudes out from the rest. As I walk past that corner a quick movement catches my eye. I look down and see a very tense, very scared skunk. I calmly try to keep walking, and thank God the skunk didn't let go. So nearly two life experiences actually: one, getting sprayed by a skunk and two, having to take a bath in tomato juice...
