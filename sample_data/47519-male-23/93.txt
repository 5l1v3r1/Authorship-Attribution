Ahh, back to the grind. A short week though, so that's okay. My laziness has caught up with me though. Now that I didn't do any grocery shopping on the weekend, there's nothing in the house, and I won't have time to get anything before I go to work. So now I have to eat out and there's not much in the way of choices out there aside from fast food. Bleh.
