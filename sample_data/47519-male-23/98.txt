Well. Super busy at work this week, so that's my lame excuse for not posting anything.  As a testament to how much I  don't  drink anymore, I went out for a drink with Brian, a buddy from work, last night after my shift. I had  one  drink and I was buzzing. No not drunk, I'm not that sad, just able to feel it. Oh well, I don't really miss it anyways.  Just looking around on  urlLink Apple  and found  urlLink this . All I can say is: WOW.
