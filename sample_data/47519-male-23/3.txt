Note to Self: Sugar-water, while being a wonderful hair-gel replacement, is very appealing to ants. Shouldn't they all be fucking hibernating or something? I mean it's nearly December! Perhaps I should stick with hair-gel for now...  On another note, it's absolutley sopping wet outside. Ah, Vancouver winter. I suppose I'd better dig out my mask and snorkel before I head out...
