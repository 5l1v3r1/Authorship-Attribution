Went on a shopping binge yesterday and bought way too much stuff. But it's all good stuff. Sporty stuff so it's stuff that I'll always be able to use. I picked up a Soccer ball, a pair of cleats, rock climbing shoes and a chalk bag. Thank god for MasterCard. Got to use my climbing shoes today. Chris and I figured since we'd been doing gym climbing so much, but now I had shoes, we'd go out to Lighthouse park and do some bouldering around there. There's nothing like being pasted on a wall 30 feet over the water with the hot BC sun beating down on you. So fun.  Got to hook up with my Uncle Ferdy from Cranbrook who's living here now. Ended up rocking out to a sweet heavy metal album that I just picked up by Probot. Got stoked to hear loud music and ended up a the Cobalt Motor Hotel on Main St. just by SkyTrain. Wicked hard, loud music that got better and better before totally breaking down at the end of the night when one of the band members of Goatsblood got into a fight with an audience member. The band kept playing as he ditched his guitar and took a flying leap off the stage to pummel the guy. "Just another night at the Cobalt," Ferdy assured me. Sweet.
