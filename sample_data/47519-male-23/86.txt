So on my way into work today I see a shirt in a womens clothing store on Robson that says "Shake your coconuts!" and has two strategically placed coconuts on the shirt. Now what would you call that? As a man I don't really think it's my place to say "That's inappropriate", but I appeal to the feminists I know and anyone who may read this, what do you think of that? Isn't that just inviting unwanted attention? I should also note it was a fairly low cut, spaghetti strap tank top.  That kind of leads into my new pet peeve: Club Wear. What the hell happened to sexy style? Now it seems whenever I'm walking down Granville at night, the women that are out clubbing are trying to do it with as little clothing as possible. To me that's not sexy, and (if I were single) I would be totally turned off of trying to strike up a conversation with that person. Then again, maybe the people in those clubs, men included, are just looking to get fucked. Literally. Not my scene.
