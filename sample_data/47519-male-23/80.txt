Well, I knew there'd be retribution for Steve Moore's hit on Markus Naslund, and I was even pretty sure Bertuzzi would be the one to do it. What I didn't figure on was that he'd break Moore's neck with a sucker punch from behind. While I support retaliation on Moore for his vicious hit, Todd went about it the complete wrong, un-sportsmanlike way. Poor form Bert.
