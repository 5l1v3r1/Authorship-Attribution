Had one of the most abnormal, yet fun and satisfying nights last night. Ended up at  urlLink The Panic's  jam space and got thrown on the drum kit and we all messed around for a few hours. I'm not a spectacular drummer, but at least I can keep time. Not bad for the third time on a kit in fifteen years...
