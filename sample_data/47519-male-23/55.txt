OK, what's up with the alarming number of sick individuals preying on the destitute women of the downtown eastside in Vancouver? It's hard for me to even try and understand the line of thinking that allows them to torture, rape and maybe even kill these women. If there's one area that makes me believe in capital punishment, this is it.
