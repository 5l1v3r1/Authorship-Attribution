Yeesh. It's funny how busy one can get. Busy enough to not even be able to update a simple website. Anyhow, it's been a fantastic summer for sports and records and stuff. First with  urlLink Greece , who had never won an international association soccer match, winning the  urlLink Euro 2004 . Then, of course, we have  urlLink Lance  winning his sixth  urlLink Tour de France  in a row. In the entire history of the 101 year old event, no cyclist has ever won six times, let alone in a row.  Congratulations Lance
