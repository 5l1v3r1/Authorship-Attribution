Saw the drunkest person ever last night. This Japanese business man on Robson St. waiting at a crosswalk, just kind of swaying. His umbrella slipped out of his hand, and as he bent over to pick it up he did this weird sort of 360 degree turn, like a dog getting comfortable, and proceeded to fall flat on his face. Now when I say business man, I mean clean cut, 3-piece suit, over coat, leather breifcase, etc. so needless to say it was a strange sight. Luckily he had a friend with him that laughed, picked him up and hailed a cab.
