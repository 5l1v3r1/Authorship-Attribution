She calls out to the man on the street Sir, can you help me?  Its cold and Ive nowhere to sleep, Is there somewhere you can tell me?  He walks on, doesnt look back He pretends he cant hear her Starts to whistle as he crosses the street Seems embarrassed to be there  Oh think twice, its another day for You and me in paradise Oh think twice, its another day for you, You and me in paradise  Think about it  She calls out to the man on the street He can see shes been crying Shes got blisters on the soles of her feet Cant walk but shes trying  Oh think twice, its another day for You and me in paradise Oh think twice, its just another day for you, You and me in paradise  Just think about it  Oh lord, is there nothing more anybody can do Oh lord, there must be something you can say  You can tell from the lines on her face You can see that shes been there Probably been moved on from every place Cos she didnt fit in there  Oh think twice, its another day for You and me in paradise Oh think twice, its just another day for you, You and me in paradise  Just think about it  Its just another day for you and me in paradise Its just another day for you and me in paradise Paradise   Phil Collins - Another Day In Paradise
