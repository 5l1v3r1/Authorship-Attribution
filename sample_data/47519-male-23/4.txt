Well after a week at work with my hair tied back people have all settled into their new nicknames for me. Strangely enough, they all seem to have chosen "The Samurai Warrior" as my new nickname, except for the one pressman who prefers "Goddamn Hippie". Randy in prepress now bows and says "Aaaaah! Sensei!" everytime he sees me, which is utterly hilarious seeming as he's forgotten more than I know about prepress, but it's kind of flattering I guess.  I  would  post a picture of it, but my goddamn digicam is busted. Oh well, I'll get the camera fixed soon enough and post a picture eventually.
