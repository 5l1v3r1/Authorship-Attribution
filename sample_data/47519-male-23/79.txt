Well, Karate went even better last night. I felt like I had more energy and stamina than the week before. Hopefully it won't be long until I get it back to acceptable levels. Went and watched Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels afterwards at Chris' place. Probably shouldn't have, as I didn't get home till 1:30, and it's now 6:45 and I've been up for fourty five minutes. Oh well.  Curling Bonspiel today. I'll be curling from 9am to 6pm. Should be a really good time.  Have had my hair re-cut. It's the full on Beckham Fauxhawk now. Colour and all. It's more subdued than before though, as the ridge doesn't stand up nearly as high. The colouring is pretty subtle too, only a couple shades lighter than my natural colour. And I've made sure that if I style it down it looks totally normal.
