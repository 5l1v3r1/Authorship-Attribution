Holy crap... I just got up. Must've needed the sleep. So much for doing the dishes this morning... Oh well, not that that upsets me a great deal ;)  Got the tickets yesterday, should be receiving an email itinerary soon. Hooray! My Angel will be home soon!  Arg. It pains me that I slept away such a beautiful morning and now the only time I'll have to go out is my walk from SkyTrain to work... Oh well...
