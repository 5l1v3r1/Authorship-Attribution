Went for a nice little hike around Buntzen Lake today with Ryan. Never been there before, but it's extremely nice. I'd love to spend a little more time around that area. Looks like there's some really awesome hikes in there as well. It'd be cool to go up there with some people and maybe do a two day hike this summer.  Can't stop watching the trailer for  urlLink Garden State . The more I watch it the more I see going on in the background. I also realise that this will be a very powerful and emotional movie. I'm starting to get emotional watching the trailer. It's the music. No not just that, the music, directors vision and the cinematography. It's everything. It's possibly the best trailer I've ever seen.
