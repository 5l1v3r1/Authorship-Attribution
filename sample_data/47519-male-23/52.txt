Just listening to The Beatles live on their first tour of the US on the radio. I can't quite grasp the mentality behind Beatlemania. They just finished playing a set on the Ed Sullivan show and the audience, whom were mostly women, just did not stop shrieking through the entire song. Not cheering, not whistling,  shrieking . I don't know, maybe you just had to be there. I should ask my Mom and Dad if they got swept up in it...
