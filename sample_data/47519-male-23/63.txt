OK, so two of my New Year's resolutions were to get in shape and eat healthier. I'm happy to say I've accomplished both. One resolution that should have been made but wasn't was to cook more at home--yes it is possible to eat out healthily! So I'm making that another resolution as of yesterday. And so far I made a great lunch, and also cooked a nice pasta dish for dinner at work. I even have enough leftovers to switch it up today and have the pasta for lunch and a huge salad for dinner. And all that for about half the price of what it usually costs to eat out for four days. Nice!
