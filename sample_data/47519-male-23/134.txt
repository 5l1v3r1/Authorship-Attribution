Okay, so that was way too long of a hiatus. But I've been super busy so I can't really blame anything.  urlLink Jen's  mom was down for one weekend, then my parents were down pretty soon after that. Couple all that with trying to watch the  urlLink Euro 2004  as much as possible. I've also been trying to avoid the computer at home since I work on it all day. But I should be updating again. In fact, it'd probably be a good way to keep in touch with  urlLink Jen  during the week, since I never see her any more...
