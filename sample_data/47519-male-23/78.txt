Saw the funniest thing walking home tonight. Cops pulling up to the Starbucks at the corner of Thurlow and Davie, and the junior parter is stuck with the task of getting coffees, etc. for the both of them. Just as she's opening the squad car door, a pickup truck blows a red light turning left from Thurlow onto Davie going extremely fast, with some floppy haired teenager driving, hanging his head out the open window going "OINKY! OINKY! OINKY!". What the hell were they expecting? I'm not sure because they sure as hell look shocked when the lights went on, the partner shut the door, and the driver busted out one of those awesome movie style cop turns. You know the ones. Where the tires are squealing/smoking and they do a super quick 180. I felt like I was watching  urlLink Starsky & Hutch . Haha, stupid shits...
