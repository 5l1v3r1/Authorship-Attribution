Well, went to a house party with Chris. Seems like this is becoming our weekend routine. It still boggles my mind how some people cannot have a good time without liquor and drugs. Quoth the 18 year old who looked like a 14 year old with stretchy track pants and pretty much no shirt: "Oh My GAWD! If I don't, like, get some marijuana soon I'll just, like, die!"  All the people, except Chris, Ben and I, were totally pasted. Eventually one guy got overly rambunctious trying to hug the other 18 year old who looked like a 14 year old, and tripped onto the kitchen table sending empties and half full bottles flying everywhere. A little while later the same guy dropped the fourty of vodka in the kitchen (smash). When the drug dealers in their pouffy jackets and sideways hats showed up, and the Aussies put on the Oh Brother, Where Art Thou soundtrack and started screaming/singing Man Of Constant Sorrow, we decided it was time to leave.  It was a fun party in which to observe drunk/stoned students in their natural habitat. I realised after we left that Chris, Ben and I were 5-7 years older than everyone there. Maybe we should stick with the pub crawling scene...
