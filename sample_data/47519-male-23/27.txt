Whew, just got back from the walk with Pete. Can hardly type my fingers are so cold. It's 5C here, but the moisture in the air just cuts to the bone. So we ended up meeting at the Blenz coffee shop around the corner and walking down Davie to the seawall, around to Science World, down through the scruffy tent city/industrial area, onto the Cambie St. Bridge, over to BC Place and finally up Robson back home. Needless to say it was a very good walk, and nice to be out in the fresh air. Took some pics with my camera, but ended up taking the best pictures right outside the apt. when I was just returning. Nice red sports car parked out front with no one in it, except for this big beautiful white dog sitting in the driver's seat, looking like an impatient chauffer waiting for the passenger who's late again. Couldn't pass up a shot of that.  Being back earlier than I figured is nice. Now I can make up my dinner for work, play a last game of FIFA 2003, grab lunch at The Dish, pick up FIFA 2004 and still head into work nice and early.  Received a phone call that made my day last night. Thanks. :)
