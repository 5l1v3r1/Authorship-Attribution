So  urlLink this  is pretty darn ridiculous. Not only am I paying levies on blank CDs that I don't even use to burn music, now  urlLink SOCAN  wants to tax ISPs because of people downloading music. So now I'll be paying more taxes that go to musicians even though I don't download music on my computer.  Note so SOCAN: All people who download music use the internet, but not all people who use the internet download music.
