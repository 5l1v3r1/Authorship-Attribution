Was on the party bus back into downtown tonight. Am starting to see the rarity in being able to have a good time sans alcohol/drugs. "Well last weekend I was so drunk when..." or "Last night I was so baked and..." were the story lead-ins for everyone having a conversation on the bus. It's funny, I went through a small phase like that during my ten months living in Halifax, but the first time I ever woke up in the drunk-tank was the last time I've ever been drunk. But it seems like most of these people don't get it. They just party it up all the time and get wasted/stoned whenever possible. Bah, I feel old saying "it's a phase", and it's doubly weird since most of the people are older than me... Then again I've never been the party going type. I don't know, I'm just ranting now, but it boggles my mind how the majority of society can't have a good time without some sort of alcoholic/narcotic influence...
