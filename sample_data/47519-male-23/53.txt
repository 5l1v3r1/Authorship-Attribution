Starting to wonder if digital photography is really the thing for me. I love film, but then there's also the fact that you have to be plugged into a computer most of the time to "process" your "digital negatives". I spent eight hours a day working on a computer, and at least one hour at home surfing the internet. I don't really feel like spending so much time on the computer, and I'm starting to dislike how much time I am spending on it. Yeah, I think for me, film is the way to go still.
