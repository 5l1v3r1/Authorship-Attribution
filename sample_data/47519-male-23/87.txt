So someone has taken to smoking cigarettes and marijuana out in the hallway of my apartment. Grr. Stinks so much.  In other news, I spent some time last night looking at some design websites such as  urlLink Computer Love  and  urlLink Newstoday . I'm thinking I'd like to redesign my website. Now it would be something completely casual, as I just don't have the time or dedication do do a complete site overhaul, nor do I really have content with which to fill it. I think I'll just take out the image on the left and add a weekly splash page. Then maybe I'll slowly build on that, but who knows.
