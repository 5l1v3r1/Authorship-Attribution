Wow. Just got back in from the  urlLink Tour de Gastown , a presigious one day cycling race touted as the fastest in Canada.  urlLink Lance Armstrong  actually won it way back in 1991 when he was 19. It was a fantastic experience, and something completely different from anything I've ever seen. The  urlLink peloton  passed by me so closely on each lap, I could have touched a rider if I didn't keep my hands right down at my sides. These men and women are elite athletes, doing 50 1.2km laps (60kms) in 80 minutes. That's averaging 45km/h on a bicycle. When the  urlLink peloton  passed by, it felt as if you were waiting for  urlLink SkyTrain  it was so breezy. So yeah, I'm going to try and make it out to this event every year now. As an added bonus this year, I met  urlLink Trevor   urlLink Linden  and got his autograph!  Also, on a different note, received an email from my Uncle Ferdy, who's on  urlLink The Feminists Third Wave Crashing Tour  right now. In the email he mentions his friend  urlLink Ben Millard  who was the singer/songwriter for a band Ferdy used to be in called Cellar of the Sun. They were fantastic, and I see Ben is continuing a solo career. Listened to most of the stuff up on his site, and it's great. You should email him for a copy of the CD.
