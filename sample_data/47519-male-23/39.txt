Urrrrghghghh... Had a wicked sore throat last night. Bad cough, y'know, the kind that keeps you up. Decided to have one tablespoon of NyQuil. Am never using NyQuil again. Slept like a stone, but it was everything I had in me to drag my ass out of bed this morning. And now I feel stoned. Well I guess I shouldn't say that, seeming as I've never done drugs, but if I had to bet money, I'd say this is what stoned feels like.
