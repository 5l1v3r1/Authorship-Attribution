Well, well... Here we go then. In keeping with the stark minimalism I've changed the Blogger button at the bottom of the page to black and white, the links are now grey, bold and underlined, and I've added pictures now. Of course the pictures are greyscale with a limited palette of eight shades of grey. Hooray! Fun!
