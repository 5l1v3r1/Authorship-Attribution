Okay, I'm totally sick of the Janet Jackson thing. Why? Because I'm sickened with the media. "Jackson more over the top than usual", "Jackson bares herself on Half-Time Show". Hell even  urlLink canada.com  is running a poll "Were you offended by Janet Jackson's breast bearing Superbowl stunt?"  Pardon me? What the fuck? Why isn't the poll "Should Justin Timberlake be charged with assult? Yes/No"? Why are people saying "Oh she must've planned it, she had a 'pastie' on her nipple"? So putting a pastie on to prevent a nipple erection gives Mr. Timberlake the right to rip off part of her costume? Have people not seen the pictures, and observed how utterly mortified she is? How it's obviously not something that she intended? Someone should direct Mr. Timberlake to  urlLink The Safety Net  and have him read up on the subject of violence against women. Men like Justin Timberlake make me sick. And that's unfortunate, because there are too many men like that in the world. Grr.
