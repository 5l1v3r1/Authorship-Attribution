Well, just got home. Ahh, good to be back in Vancouver. Met Phil on the 424, in from England and had no idea where he was going, but I knew the hostel he was heading to and took him there, then caught a cab home. The cabbie had the most pungent BO ever. I seriously nearly threw up in the back seat. I could smell it when I opened the door. *gags*
