While the new graphics and everything look bloody amazing, and I'm super hyped for the game, I'm also fairly disappointed that it seems the lovely cel-shading has been done away with. I guess that's from everyone crying sour grapes over "teh kiddie" graphics. Personally I was one of the people, whom were few, that were ecstatic about The Wind Waker's graphics and felt they suited the Zelda franchise much better than the OoT style graphics. Miyamoto-san says he wanted this adventure to be more "mature", but I think they could've easily achieved the same feeling with cel-shaded graphics. Imagine The Wind Waker with a dull, earthy colour palette and lots of volumetric weather effects. Would've been sweet. I'll still cling to the hope that, as Nintendo must've been developing this new Zelda in secret, they're doing the same right now with a cel-shaded game...
