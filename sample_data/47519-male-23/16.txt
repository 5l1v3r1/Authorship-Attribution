So yeah, nothing's really changed at all in this little town I used to call home. It's kind of nice to come to a familiar place and be welcomed by family. Having BBQ'd Steaks tonight and I'm really looking forward to it. Then we're watching T3 on the new DVD player. Not entirely looking forward to that, but eh... Flying out tomorrow. Kind of wish I could stay a little longer.
