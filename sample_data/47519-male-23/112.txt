Well, I know that I haven't been updating regularly. I'm sorry. Been busy with work and with Jen being home it almost seems pointless to be updating. I'm sure she's the only person that probably bothers to read this site anyways, ha. Work's going well, really busy, which is good but I just can't seem to get into work mode lately. The idea of Jen being in town and me sitting here pushing a mouse around instead of spending time with her is distracting. I'll try and be more regular about posting. Probably more like once a week though...   Who controls the past now, controls the future Who controls the present now, controls the past.  Rage Against The Machine - Testify
