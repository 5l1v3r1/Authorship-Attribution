I've been pouring over all my graphic design books, which are mostly by Josef Mller-Brockmann and Emil Ruder, and I've decided that design nowadays is totally lacking in good typography. Designers of yesterday [being before computers/desktop publishing] that had a fundamental grasp on design methods and techniques could create typographic solutions to design problems with little or no reliance on photographs, icons or images of any sort. I've decided that that is what I'm going to strive for in my work: typographic emphasis rooted in classic constructivist [Swiss] design.
