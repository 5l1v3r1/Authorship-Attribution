Well last night was, bar none, the least productive night I've ever had at work. Freaking computers. Sometimes I hate them. After multiple crashes, reboots, hang-ups, server meltdowns, Prinergy reboots and all around bad karma, Rod and I got basically nothing done. And I think the bad karma carried over to this morning as I got woken up at 8am by a jackhammer, 9am by the garbage truck, 9:30am by a telemarketer, and I gave up at 10am when the crows and seagulls woke me up... Things seemed to have stopped there though, as it's an incredibly beautiful day when it was forcast to rain...  *crosses fingers that computer problems are fixed*
