Sorry I've missed a couple days. I've been so busy. Had the SunRun on Sunday, which I nearly missed, then Chris and I went and played soccer right afterwords so yeah, my legs are friggin sore. Yesterday was nicely busy at work and then I made it back into town soon enough to catch the third period of the game. Pretty exciting that Matt Cooke tied it up with 5 seconds left, we nearly blew the roof off Steamworks. Auld played really well, but where were his defencemen? Two huge stops, but impossible to not give up a rebound on that second stop. Someone should've been there to clear the puck. Ah well. Every bar was totally crowded afterwords. People going to drown their sorrows I'm sure. Montreal though hey? Sweet.
