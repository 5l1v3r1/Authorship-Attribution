Uuuuurhghgh. Cops didn't show until 2:00am. Buzzed  me  to let them in. Woke me up. Left around 2:45am, but not before knocking on my door to ask a couple questions. Woke me up,  again . Decided to give up and grabbed a quick hot chocolate at the Blenz around the corner. Asleep at 3:30am. Up now. Feel like skivving off curling today, which pisses me off to no end as I really enjoy it. If I had a good night's sleep I'd be in a great mood and ready to go out. Right now I'm just tired and bitchy and I look like shite...
