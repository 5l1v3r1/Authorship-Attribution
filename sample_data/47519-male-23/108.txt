So, in keeping with my lo-tech theme, I'm completely enamoured with pixels. I've been finding myself playing around with Photoshop, and creating nothing but hand-drawn, little pixel-perfect artworks. Icons, pixel fonts and the like. I'm really enjoying myself. I figure over the summer I'll spend time just rearranging my blog and designing stuff for it until I finally redesign the whole thing. Huzzah for old technology. Vectors? Who need's em!  Well That's a little overly sarcastic. I still love my vectors too, but I'm totally diggin' the pixels. I'd love to be running an old version of Photoshop on, say, System 7.5.3. Yeah.
