I think I'm definetly going to go into work about an hour early every day. There's a high school just around the corner from SkyTrain where I get off and I can't stand all the snot-nosed brats taking over the whole freaking station/street/sidewalk etc. I feel like  I'm  in high school again. And I dislike that, very much...  Best of luck on your law mid-term Honey!
