Ahh, back to the grind. Many things to do this week apart from working. Menial labour such as: do the dishes (bleh), do the laundry (bleh), vacuum the house. There are less fun things happening as well like: doctors appointment on Thursday (bleh). But there are nice things to get to such as: buy plane tickets for my beautiful angel for reading break (hooray!). It's shaping up to be a good week. :)
