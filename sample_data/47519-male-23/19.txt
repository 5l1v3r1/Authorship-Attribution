So went out for a nice walk today, saw a woman walking around with a German WWII jacket on... Not too sure how I should feel about that. Eh, oh well.  Got some Christmas shopping done, the most important stuff in my mind. Should all be ready to pick up next week. I'm excited about it and it's all really nice. Getting so close to Christmas now, I can't help but smile as I walk through all the shops and malls with everything all set out.
