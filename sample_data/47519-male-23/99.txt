Seriously, why do movie companies paste stuff on cool box sets? If I want to see the chapter listing I'll look at the booklet that comes with the movie. Don't, for God's sake, paste crap on nicely designed box sets. See The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Special Extended DVD Edition for more details.
