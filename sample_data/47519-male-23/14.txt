Urgh... I'm sick as a dog, and it's gross and rainy out and it's forecast to be gloomy/rainy all week... I hope I'm not sick all week.  Curling this weekend, so that's something to look forward to. Maybe I'll give Burgess and Vista a call and go out for dinner with them at some point. That is, if I'm feeling better... Bleh...
