Knew it was coming. Finally saw it today. Two people wearing the same type of Diesel jeans with the same "dirt stains" and "wear holes" in the same place. Of course these guys didn't know each other but one was walking down the street about five paces behind the other. I thought that was so funny. Pay $400 for a pair of jeans only to have some guy wearing the same exact pair, right down to the holes...
