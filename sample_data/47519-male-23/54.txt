So I'm on my way home last night, passed the Stone Temple Night Club and notice a heated argument between four people. It's starting to get a little physical. I've always had a fascination with street fights so I figure I'll watch some poor shit get his ass whipped. Big mistake. Let me break it up for you. Three obviously-on-steroids white guys arguing with one black guy. Black guy comes across the street (where I am) and starts lipping off the guys again. "The Group" comes across the street and things really get physical, one guy grabs black guy by the throat. At this point they're moving way too close to me and I'm starting to back away. Then black guy reaches into his pocket and whips out a big-ass knife and starts swinging. I move, guy next to me (one of "The Group") gets slashed in the arm, someone pulls out the pepper spray, and I get the fuck out of dodge...  Needless to say I think I'm through partying for now...
