Well last night was better, but still a little sluggish. Network connections, I mean. On the other hand, I had my first ever Krispy Kreme doughnut last night. It was excellent. As good as everyone says they are. I wonder how the coffee was first thing this morning? Dave thought it'd be a wonderful joke to put our left over wasabi from dinner in with the coffee grounds... Bleh... Should be some interesting reactions...
