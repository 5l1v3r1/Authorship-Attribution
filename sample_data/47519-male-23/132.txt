Well I had a bit of a strange weekend. Excluding Friday, that was nice to spend time with Jen. Saturday however, the weirdness started. I went to an open casting call for martial artists to be in the next  urlLink Jean-Claude Van Damme  movie  urlLink Kumite . I actually got a call back and had to go in on Sunday. But I think I was too skinny. And not flashy enough. The guys they seemed to like were either 300lb monsters or skinny chinese guys that could do standing double backflips and stuff. So yeah. But it was fun none the less, and neat that I got a call back.  I also found out that  urlLink Oakley  has  never  had lifetime warranties on their eyewear. It's always been one year warranties. They did however provide free repairs on frames, which some dealers translated into "lifetime warranty". Three years ago they realised that they were losing money providing this service, as people were just sending in broken frames with requests for different colours and such, so they started charging a fee. Anyhow, they also don't offer to replace your glasses with new ones if yours are outdated. So, that means I get a $60 credit on my outdated Eyejackets, because they can't repair them and replacement frames for my  urlLink M Frames  cost $50. So with a $10 credit left I lose one pair of glasses and get new frames for my  urlLink Positive Red Iridium Heater  lenses.
