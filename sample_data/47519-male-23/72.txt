Through the water, from the sky On the wind or in our minds What is there for me to do Find my way back home to you Before the autumn air turns black Before the angry men attack Together when the sky falls through A flash of red, I'll fuse with you  Fuse with you, I'm dying to Running to your side Now it's here, the pain, the fear Tha fall have all arrived A kiss goodbye  In the city, unprepared Run and hide, stand and stare Buildings crumble in my head Wave a flag, raise the dead Money fuels the fires of war Only love worth dying for Together when the sky falls through A flash of red, I'll fuse I'll fuse with you  Fuse with you, I'm dying to Running to your side Now it's here, the pain, the fear Tha fall have all arrived Oh my dear, the pain, the fear The fall have all arrived A kiss goodbye  We're all the same, running from the flames We're on our way, don't you feel it The air will ring, oh the end of everything We're on our way, don't you feel it The air will ring, the end of everything We're all the same, don't they feel it   The Folk Implosion - Fuse
