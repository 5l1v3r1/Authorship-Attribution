Ahh, to be in Dublin for  urlLink this . Image Now Gallery is putting on a four week exhibition of Josef Mller-Brockmann's posters. 48 of them, so twelve every week. Admission is free. MB is my favourite designer ever and to be there to see his actual posters in person would be possibly the most inspiring thing ever.
