Watched Minority Report last night. I really like that show, though many think it sucked. Speaking of sucking, I'm going to go see The Matrix: Revoloutions this afternoon. All the reviews I've seen have been like two out of five stars, and Rolling Stone magazine just out and says "At the risk of understatement, The Matrix Revolutions sucks." in the first sentence of their review... So I'm not sure what to expect... I'm meeting some friends after they're done car shopping. That's interesting too, I wonder if they'll find/buy anything today?  There's a chance I could be going to go see Kill Bill for a third time on Sunday, but I'm not sure yet. Yes, I like that movie enough to pay to see it three times... It does not suck.
