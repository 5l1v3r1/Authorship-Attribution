God, why does dealing with the Government have to be so   freakin   difficult? I just want to pay off my $110 loan all at once. No I don't want a 5 month amortization period. Argh, I'm so pissed off I could just scream and pull my hair out. And it doesn't help that the people on the phone speak next to no English.
