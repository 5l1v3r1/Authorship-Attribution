Saw the most hilarious Juxtaposition on the way into work yesterday. Big Lexus SUV, Gold plated or something. Not chrome, it seriously looked like gold. Tricked out wheels, thumping stereo, urban-chic black guy driving it. Listening to possibly the most vulgar gansta rap I've heard. Lots of Niggas, and bitches and hos and mothafuckas and glocks and bustin caps, etc etc etc etc... As he rolls past me I notice his rear lisence plate holder, which oddly enough is gold as well, it says: "In God I Trust". And off to the right of that there's a little gold fish with "Jesus" in it. I just had to laugh out loud. This is the same kind of stuff I find funny as when the rappers themselves win awards for spewing more obscenity than last year, and the first person they thank on the podium is "Our wonderful Lord Jesus Christ, without whom, none of this would be possible."  Do they really think Jesus would listen to their crap? WWJLT? (haha)...
