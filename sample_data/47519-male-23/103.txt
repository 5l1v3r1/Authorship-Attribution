Whent to see Shrek 2 last night. It was great. Every bit as good as the original, which is a very good thing. It seems to me that so many movie sequels just pale in comparison to the originals, so it's nice to the the writing, directing, comedy, etc. all at the same levels. There were also some awesome trailers before the show. The new  urlLink Incredibles  trailer and  urlLink The Terminal  trailer. Some of the not so hot trailers included  urlLink Spongebob Squarepants The Movie  *shudder*
