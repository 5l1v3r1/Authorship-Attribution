Well... I meant to post yesterday, but oh well. It's 1:30, so I only missed it by an hour and a half. I went up to Lynn Valley on the North Shore on Saturday and it was pretty much a spiritual experience. I've never been in such a beautiful place in my life. I'm definetly going back, and I'm definetly going to be exposing a lot of reversal films in that place. I'm utterly speechless in trying to describe it though. Hopefully my images can do it justice...
