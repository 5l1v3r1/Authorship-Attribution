So generally I don't post more than once a day, but this here's an exception because  urlLink Jen  has issued a challenge and it must be answered. On a side note, I may as well post that the new-ish Sloan album Action Pact is utterly amazing. I bought it last year when it came out, listened to one song and put it away. I put it on yesterday and listened to the whole thing and I'm kicking myself for not doing that before. It's a great album and it's starting to embody my Vancouver spring 2004. OK, so, on to the challenge...   1. Favourite book and why?   The Lord of the Rings, all three, because I enjoy the fantastical elements.   2. Favourite movie and why?   The LOTR trilogy, because it looks exactly as how I pictured the books.   3. Best friend (other than current partner) and why this person?   Too difficult to select one friend out of the wonderful few that I've had as "the best".   4. What are you doing now?   Answering this challenge.   5. What do you wish you were doing now?   Taking a windy walk along the seawall with Jen.   6. Your personal motto OR a song that describes you perfectly?   Give your all, but never be afraid to fail, you always learn the most from your mistakes.   7. Personal hero and why?   Jen, for doing what she wants and never letting anyone/thing hold her back.   8. Why do you have a blog?   I figured my daily ramblings may interest someone on The Interweb...
