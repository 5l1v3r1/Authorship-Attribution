Well, I've been really lazy with my blog this week. Forgive me, but Jen's home and I've also been busy at work, so I haven't had much time. As Jen's posted in her  urlLink LJ , I'm now sporting a Beck's style  urlLink Fauxhawk  haircut, albeit with no colouring. Sure it's, like, so two years ago, but I don't care. I've never been trendy...
