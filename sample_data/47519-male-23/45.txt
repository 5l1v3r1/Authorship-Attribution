It's the day after my birthday!  But seriously, there's not much to tell. I just went to work as per usual and upheld the tradition of buying doughnuts for the whole company. Five dozen later... No one asked me the yearly trite question: "So, do you feel any older?", which is unfortunate as, for the first time in my life, I would've been able to say yes. But all in all it was a great day and I'm going to use all my gift money to buy way too many CDs.
