So yeah, I have this wonderful idea that I'll do laundry today because it's a day off. All I've got to do is go to the bank and get some change. Wait... It's a stat... Banks will be closed... Damnit... I'm getting into the recycling underwear stage and I've got to go in early to work on Wed/Thurs... I'm tempted to pack a suitcase full of dirty laundry to take home to do over the weekend... Hey, it'd save me $20...
