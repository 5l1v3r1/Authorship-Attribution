Went out to the last night of the 10th Annual  urlLink Rock For Choice  show in Vancouver. Pretty wicked turn-out and hardcore rockin music. All for an excellent cause.  On a semi-unrelated note, am now completely into The Smalls, thanks to Ryan of  urlLink The Panic . I'd say The Smalls are an unclassifiable blend of rock, punk, country and speed metal. They hail from Edmonton, Alberta and it's a shame they're not making music anymore, but they did put out four awesome albums. I'm coming to appreciate Canadian music so much.
