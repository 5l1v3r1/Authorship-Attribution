Hooray for getting people arrested. Was on my way home last night when I witnessed a guy threaten a Chinese food take-out guy, along with calling him a bunch of racial slurs and kick in windows in two restaurants on his way up the street. Followed him and ran around an alley to cut him off where I knew there was a police office. Got the cops out there and they arrested him and stuffed him in the paddy wagon, but not before he told the cops that they're "not so tough, let me out of these cuffs and I'll kill you all." Nice guy.  Feel incredibly good about making a difference. Want to go be a cop now.
