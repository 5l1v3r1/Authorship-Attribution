What a weekend. Didn't end up getting anything done at all that I needed to, except a bit of laundry, but not even all of that. I did, however, do some rock climbing and had the best day at the gym yet. Killed some routes that have been mocking me for a while. I'd like to try climbing with Jen when she gets home. Which is tomorrow. It's seriously hard to believe we've been apart for nearly a year now. We're one third of the way there. I can't wait to pick her up in the airport tomorrow. It's going to be really special. I promise to try and keep posting when she's home. ;)
