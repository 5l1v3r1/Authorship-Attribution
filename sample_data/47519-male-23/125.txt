You'd think that Concorde Pacific, well first you'd think a multinational real estate development company would have a webstie. Anyhow, you'd think that Concorde Pacific would have a little more organization than what they just did.  urlLink The Molson Indy  is this weekend. Concorde Pacific wanted some postcards printed for the event, to showcase some future developments that are happening around the Indy Track. They must've just decided this, because we got the files yesterday afternoon, printing right this minute, deliver by 10:00am tomorrow. Hello. HUGE international event. Last minute stuff is BAD.
