Super busy this weekend in Victoria, visiting Tammy and Adam and also cleaning Jen's Grandma's place out as it's now sold.  My  urlLink Lance Armstrong  Bracelets came in today. As well as my new  urlLink Oakleys . I'm happy as they asked what colour I wanted and I said black, but received carbon fibre styled ones instead. Nice.         </Blog>
