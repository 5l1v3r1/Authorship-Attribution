Stopped at an arcade on my way home last night. Not something I usually do at all, but I couldn't help it. They had this "game" called Dragon Punch set up right in the front window. It was less of a game than a competition. You hit a hanging punching bag as hard as you can and a computer measures your power. The high score was 6980 and I got 6940 on my first shot, so that's not too bad considering a most of the people weren't breaking 5500. It was pretty fun, but eventually this guy came in and was just glaring at people as he pulled off flashy martial arts moves on the bag. He wasn't putting money in the machine or actually hitting the bag hard, just touching it, but I'm thinking he was wanting to get into a fight. He would, for example, walk right in front of someone about to put in a coin, glare at me for a second and then do some roundhouse kick. Technically his moves were good, but I just didn't understand what he was trying to pull. He never said anything at all. He'd single out one person, glare at them, then do a move. It was pretty weird. I put up with it for a couple minutes then left, I don't have the time for that sort of arrogance. I don't get people like that.
