I'm posting this from my Mom's laptop in my old house in Cranbrook right now. Wireless technology, my parents are using it and I am not. I feel behind the times. Ah, well... Good flight in, considering we landed and didn't die. Was so foggy the pilot announced that we may have to turn back to Vancouver. He decided to attempt the landing anyways, and it was the roughest landing I've ever had in my life. I couldn't even see the tarmac from my window after we had touched down... Hopefully it won't be a life risking flight on the way back... Kind of weird to be back home but it should be fun.
