urlLink Hell Media  has to be one of the most beautiful sites on the Internet. I love it.  I see that  urlLink Nintendo  is/was showing a really cool game to be released soon called  urlLink Paper Mario 2 . It looks awesome. A Mario Bros. RPG [as was the first]. I think I may have to pick it up. See  urlLink IGN  for more details.  Speaking of  urlLink IGN , I really hate the new redesign as I cannot use Internet Explorer with it anymore. Boo!
