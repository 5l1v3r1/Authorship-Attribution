Me so tired!   The hypochondriac is fine, just tired. My neck is pretty much back to normal and my breathing issues are under control thanks to my new little inhaler. I just am not getting enough sleep - but then, who does these days, right? ;-)  Busy weekend, lots of work, meetings, etc, but I did get to see Andrew's band, QuarterAcre, and Graeme's band, Seconds Away, at Vic on the Park so that was good.  And I had some good chats with Javier and Dhruv.  I really have to thank friends like Dhruv, Shayna, Javier, Brian, Rach, and others who know who they are, who never give up on me even though I have completely sucked when it comes to keeping up my side of the friendship. Poor Dhruv in particular has been trying to ring me for like the last 6 months and just got a hold of me this weekend. And Shayna just asks for a quick email every now and then and I'm just so lazy. And Javier has written actual snail mail letters and sent me tapes/CDs and  have I returned the favour yet? Nup. Why? Because I suck. I'm trying to turn my slacker ways around....it's really weird. I don't know how to explain it. I do think about these friends and I keep thinking that I must get in touch, but then I keep putting it off and the next thing you know, months have gone by.  So bad! So anyway, thanks you guys, for somehow feeling that I am worth all the effort. I hope to prove you right! Mwah! :-)  Went to see Matt's band,  urlLink Mersea , tonight. It made for a very cool Monday - I really enjoyed the set. Well done, Mr. Styx!
