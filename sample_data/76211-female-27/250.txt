p.s. People in Perth are so nice! I already know this, but case in point...basically my hostel was supposed to be closed between 11am-4pm today, just for Xmas, and my flight got in after 10am, so I didn't know if I could check in in time, so the hostel employee emailed me the code to the building and left my key behind a secret spot in the entrance - how sweet is that? Very trusting! They said to just pay for my room when the office hours opened later. As it turned out, I got there in just the nick of time and was able to pay upfront, but my key was already waiting for me in the hiding place. Two thumbs up!!! And more thumbs for the manager who gave me several pieces of Cadbury chocolate! ;-)  So far I am the only one in my dorm room - hope it lasts! ;-)
