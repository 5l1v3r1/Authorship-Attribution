Bye Bye Bush   So, this is a bit overdue, but I forgot to expess my relief that Dubya has left the country. Thank goodness. I spoke to my father last night and he said that he was worried he'd see me on TV protesting against Bush - it was very tempting, I have to admit. So did Dubya bring anymore cowboy boots for Johnny? I didn't read anything about souvenirs from the States. If lil' Johnny thinks he can pull of any cowboys boots for one hot second, he's got another thing coming! Meanwhile, I have been proudly wearing my 'Dubya' (Zero Tolerance for Zero Intelligence) t-shirt.    Bookworm Heaven   I am in bookworm heaven right now. I am slightly alarmed at my book induced ADD at the moment, but I'm still happy. Right now I'm reading  A Few Short Notes on Tropical Butterflies  by John Murray,  How the Mind Works  by Steven Pinker,  Small World: Uncovering Nature's Hidden Networks  by Mark Buchanan, and  Dude, Where's My Country?  by Michael Moore. I've had to put the two other books I was reading on hold for the time being. I am  loving  all four of the above mentioned books and I am finding it very fun and easy to go back and forth and read a chapter of one here, a chapter of another there. And in between reading them, I do some writing exercises. It's been a very inspiring weekend.
