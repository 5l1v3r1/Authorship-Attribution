Back from Newcastle   Back from my long weekend in Newcastle with the ever-cool  urlLink Shay  and  urlLink Fidelma .  Good times indeed! Much fun!  I may actually write about some highlights when my head isn't pounding - damn sinus headaches! ;-) Me duele la cabeza! Perhaps the phrase I have used most in Spanish over the years!  Happy Belated B-day to Sal!
