Music festivals, anyone?    Sat - Alive Festival - Wollongong  I'll be spending all day Saturday in Wollongong at the  urlLink Alive Festival . It's free + all ages, featuring 28 Days, After The Fall, and Countersunk, between 1-5pm, so come on down if you can...should be fun...I'm looking forward to seeing the bands, taking photos, etc.    Sun - Newtown Festival - Newtown (doh)  Ah, the good ol' Newtown Festival is here once again! Can't wait to see Craiggles, Sarah Blasko, and a ton of friends that are going to be lurking around at various points during the day...  So I was going to type up a few funny incidents I haven't had time to blog about yet, but my bed is calling me. I'm beat...and since I have to be ready to go at like 9am tomorrow (on a Saturday, sob!) I better get to bed....night!
