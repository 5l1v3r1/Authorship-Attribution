p.s. The first pic is of Shay, Kristen, and me taken on the day Shay and Co. took pity on us Yanks and started teaching us the rules of Cricket. Sal got us Aussified and took the pic - thanks Sal! And thanks to Shay for being so patient :) And thanks to Andy and Chad for not laughing too much at us ;) The 2nd pic is of Jorge and I at Mardi Gras. To think we saw our first Mardi Gras parade in Sydney 4 years ago!
