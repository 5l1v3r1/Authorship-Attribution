Fridays That Feel Like Mondays Can't Be Good!  Crazy crazy day, as usual. Tonight should be a fairly quiet night, feasting on some yummy Spanish Tapas, hanging out with a few friends then going home to play the "What can I save on my computer now?" Game! I finally found my warranty receipt for my illing computer. It's good through October 2003, so hopefully Compaq Sydney will come through for me. (Fingers crossed! Toes too!)   Today I called my cousin Rob around 11pm his time in the U.S. I called him on my mobile phone, so I only spoke to him for a few minutes, planning a good catch-up session for the weekend. It was funny, I was like, "Happy, Happy 18th Birthday! I can't talk long, I'm on a cell phone and I'm in the ladies' toilets at work!" I'm all about class, really.   Tomorrow night I'm going to my friend Lisa's birthday bash in Mosman. I might actually try to put up a few recent amusing stories here this weekend, computer permitting.  There's a fun press conference coming up in two weeks - part two of the  Black Hawk Down  series. This time Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer will be fielding the questions. So if any of you have some juicy questions you'd like me to ask them,  urlLink mail me .
