No time to write tonight, I worked late, so I'm buggy-eyed. Just one bit of advice: Never use Dove Body Wash as shampoo when you run out of real shampoo. This morning I was in the shower, just got my hair all wet when I realised I was totally out of shampoo. Once before, maybe 8 months ago, the same thing happened so I used Herbal Essences body wash as shampoo because I was desperate. That actually worked pretty well. However, stupid me went and used Dove  Moisturising  Body Wash, which I absolutely love because it does make my skin all super silky soft. However, I was basically shampooing like 75% moisturiser into my super-fine long hair. It weighed my hair down - I looked like cousin IT after a day at the beach, with sunscreen in my hair or something. Of course I'm sure no one else noticed it but me but that's because I work with all boys ;)  Anyhoo, a word to the wise... :)  p.s. I never thought I'd stoop so low as to write a blog about a "bad hair day!" ;)
