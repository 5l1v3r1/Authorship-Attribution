Thank You!   I guess I have known it for a while, but this last week has made me remember and appreciate even more: I have awesome friends and family. I love you guys very much and thank you to everyone. You all rock! I will post pics from Friday and from tonight (after they're taken!) and will give a lowdown of what went on, but just a quickie to say thank you all for coming down to The Rose last night - I had a fabulous time! And huge thanks to some very special folks who were there in spirit (In San Fran, Paris, New Hampshire, Sydney, Springfield, Dublin etc) - will give proper thank you list later!  Happy birthday (today) to my cousin Jeff, from his 'older and wiser ' cousin Lori ;-)
