Brain-dead and hungry   Lordy I am beat. Just spent three hours with a client, going over their website (it seemed like 1000 pages!) in painstaking detail, and this was after working on the site yesterday from 9.30am to 10pm and working on it about 80% of the day, every day for the last week.  Lots of content, plenty of html, menu organising, and a shitload of image manipulation to remove unsightly backgrounds and other undesirable things.  I didn't each lunch today cause I was busy working on the site (as I kept receiving more info for it until about 15 minutes before I had to leave for the meeting)  and now I am STARVING! I need to not look at the site until tomorrow morning. I need a break!  Must go get food!!!!
