Film Critics, Take Notice!   Actually, forget film critics -  everyone  take notice! There are some fantastic up & coming student filmmakers, and to be honest, they're really not so much up & coming as actually here. They are officially 'arrived.'  Went to the  National Student Film & Video Fesetival  tonight @ Sydney Uni's Manning Bar. It was a crap night weather-wise but a nice crowd turned out for the evening. The showed the first and second place films for all the categories and the evening was hosted by Mr. Jay Katz, who has a lovely old-fashioned voice and I mean that as a compliment.   I'll have more of a story about this on Yap soon, but just wanted to make mention of it - I was very impressed by the excellent selection. I hope to see some of these filmmakers in Tropfest in February as I think Tropfest could use a boost!
