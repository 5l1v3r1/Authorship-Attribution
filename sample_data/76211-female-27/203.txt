Home Improvements   Just a quick note to say that 'home improvements' should not be allowed to begin before 8am. I am dying to meet the person who lives in the unit above me and ask him/her why (for over a year now) they always feel the need to use a powerdrill and a hammer before 7am. Bastard! Get a new hobby - something quiet, like reading, dammit! :D
