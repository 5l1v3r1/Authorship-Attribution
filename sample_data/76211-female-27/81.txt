The Drugs Do Work   Congrats to The Drugs! I just got confirmation from their lovely Record Label Gal that The Drugs are going to appear on Rove Live on July 2nd with Ridge from  The Bold & the Beautiful  with their brand-spanking new single "The Bold & the Beautiful," surprisingly enough.  Be sure to check 'em out on Rove and there's lots going on in Sydney tomorrow night, but my pick is still The Drugs @ the Annandale.   This weekend is finally the  urlLink Sydney Writer's Festival  which I bet some people are sick of listening/reading me blog about all the damn time.. Don't worries, kiddies, it'll be over by Monday. ;-) Looking forward to it!  Tomorrow our friend Lisa arrives from the States. Just when one little Boston Uni Yankee leaves, another one arrives. We've got a constant flow of Yankees here! Watch out, Australia, we're multiplying.   Off to meet some friends for drinks now, I think. I say "I think" because I'm currently sitting nice and comfy and warm on my couch and the longer I stay here, the less likely I am to move. :)
