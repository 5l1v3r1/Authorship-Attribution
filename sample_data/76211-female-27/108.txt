"We Are Family....I Got All My Relatives and Me"   Okay, so it really doesn't flow well...'relatives' is a little too long, but I don't have sisters, so what's an only child to do. Just a quick lowdown to say thanks to all the relatives I saw today. I had an excellent time with my grandmother, Babci, and my Uncle Frank during the day, and then a very very fun night with my Auntie Kate and Auntie Jo. Thanks heaps, you guys! I'll elaborate more tomorrow, I'm bushed!  Night!
