urlLink   (Pssst! I've posted new pics throughout the blog, so scroll down the past week or so to see! ) Let me tell you, it was tough going to work today after having some time off! It was pretty damn hot on the 6th floor (top floor) of a building with no air-conditioning. But we survived. As I always say, I'd rather sweat than shiver!   I'm gearing up for my writers' group meeting this Sunday and a gig at the Metro on Saturday...the weekend is looking good....thank you to Shayna, Lisa, Rachel, and Babci for the cards I received in the mail (old fashioned snail mail - woo-hoo!) today. I feel so loved :)
