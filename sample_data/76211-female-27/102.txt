Dictators, Sitcom Stars, Oh My   I got sent this link today. Too funny. It's called "Guess the Dictator or Television Sit-Com Character." You just pick someone in your head, answer some questions and they'll take a  urlLink wild guess . I've done about 7 people and they're right every time! Yeah, so I haven't gotten much work done, in case you couldn't tell. ;-)
