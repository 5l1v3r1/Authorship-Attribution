Seeing red...    It takes a lot to really get me angry, but angry I was today. I won't get into it here, but someone in my life was acting like a total tool today. I have been taken for granted for way too long and today this person went too far and I had to speak my mind. We all act like tools sometimes, but when a tool is a tool and pretends like he or she isn't a tool, he/she needs to be put in their place.   Today was a pretty emotional day for me in all sorts of way and on all sorts of levels that I cannot write here, as it's too personal. You'll just have to take my word for it.  As Sydney band "The Drugs" always say, "The only way is up..."  :)
