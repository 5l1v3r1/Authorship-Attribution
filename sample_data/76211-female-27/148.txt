Yeah, Baby, Yeah!   Going to see Austin Powers: Goldmember tonight, finally! Yay! I warned my friends that I would be bringing in a chicken burrito to eat during the movie and if they had any problems with that, they should not sit next to me. What I mean by that is, I know some weird people who freak out if you eat anything other than 'normal' theatre stuff, i.e. popcorn, candy, ice cream during a film. I just don't get it. As long as I don't get it on  you , who cares? Okay, Brian is going to kill me for putting up that pseudo-Austin Powers pic, but that is me as a pathetic Felicity Shagwell (unfortunately I've got nothing on Heather Graham, physically) and that's my homeboy Brian as the cute Austin. The photo still cracks me up after all these years. The CEOs watching us doing a photo-shoot on the roof in Boston and my father agonising over the length of my "dress" - "Why did it have to be that short??????????!" etc. etc.     Jorge's back in town - I had to hang out at his place last night waiting for him to arrive as I have the only keys to his apartment. We caught up and he made me jealous telling me stories about Europe...sigh...this is a pic of me and Jorge at my b-day dinner. Which reminds me I still haven't linked to my b-day photogallery. Ooopsies!
