La Noche de Nachos   Huge thanks to Ruth for having me over for dinner tonight. We had yummy nachos and wine and nachos and more wine. Ruth can talk as much as I do, if that gives you any indication of the great chat session we had. :-) It was a good night of gossip! I was telling Ruth about this poem I wrote yesterday. It's in Spanish and the English translation is SO cheesy, but of course it sounds nice in Spanish. It's probably not all correct, but I think most of it is okay. I had my first dream in Spanish ever two nights ago and I woke up yesterday morning and wrote about it. It's a sad poem about a fisherman who has never known love before. I'll post it here, soon. I think :-)  Sueos felices!
