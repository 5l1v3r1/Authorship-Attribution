ARRRRRGGGHHH   It is 11pm. I am at work. A file I was working on just crashed. The program said it had saved the file before the 'unrecoverable error' occurred. The program lied.  :p   :-(  Anyhoo, I'm taking that as a sign to go home! But to cheer me up before I go, I'll have another look at my favourite  urlLink Head Monkey,  George (Dubya is for Wanker) . Turn your volume up, gather 'round your friends, family, and co-workers, hell, grab strangers off the street and watch and listen to the whole thing!  (Thanks to Jer for the link!)  Nighty night!
