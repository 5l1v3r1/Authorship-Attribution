Viva la computadora!   My computer lives! AMEN!  Dear ladies and gentleman of the internet, I weep before you with astounding happiness. This is the first time I've used my computer successfully (i.e. without it dying or me wanting to kill it) since about May. Yay! Yay! Yay! Huge HUGE thanks to my boys at work! They rock SO hard! :-)  Going to see Big Heavy Stuff and Faker Friday night at the Annandale Hotel - you should all check it out because a) it's two great bands, people! and b) even more importantly, the $10 cover goes to a great cause - youth suicide prevention.   Saturday night methinks there shall be some dancing going on - that is if I get over this annoying uber-tiredness thing I've got going on!  Last night's presentation of the latest Maya software features @ Hoyts George St was pretty cool. Damian thought I was going to kill him for inviting me along, but in spite of the geeky presenters, everything was pretty funky. Makes you really appreciate all those special effects and amazing animating action we take for granted these days.  We also got to see  Reign of Fire  which was worth it just to see Christian Bale and Matthew McConnoughey looking so buff ;-)
