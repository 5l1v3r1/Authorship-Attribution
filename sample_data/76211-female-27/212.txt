X-Men and Girl Talk   It was quite a good weekend with the exception of a few tense work moments..but let's not dwell on that now..Friday night I saw  X-Men 2  with Damian and crew and it totally rocked. Didn't show quite enough of Hugh Jackman/Wolverine's bod, but overall, I was pretty happy. And I was very psyched to see the female characters kicking some major ass! Go ladies!  Saturday night I had lots of good girl chat with the lovely Claudine. We had dinner at Kilaminjaros on King St., Newtown, (that African restaurant I mentioned last month) and it was just as yummy as last time. We then headed to Gloria Jeans in the city and stayed there until they kicked us out, then headed over to Paddy Maguires where Chad eventually joined us.   Today I had lunch with Jorge and had a good catch-up. I got a fair bit of writing done this weekend too - so that was good. I had to buy a new journal as I finished the last one. Hope to get through this one faster ;-)   My interview with Jimeoin on Friday went okay considering he rang me early and I was totally not ready for him and horrified that I was caught offguard - but I recovered okay, I think. He offerred to join my imaginary band after I told him about it, but insisted that he would be the lead singer and that I would be the triangle player, but I said, "No way, buddy!" ;-) More about that later...  The funniest phone call I got this weekend was from Fleur who called me from Melbourne to ask if I wanted to go on a single's cruise next year. I was laughing like, "Gee, you have such faith in us, thinking we'll both still be single a year from now!" ;-)
