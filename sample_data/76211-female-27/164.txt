Happy Halloween!   Went out to dinner in Newtown last night with Gavin and Glenn...we had red curry barrimundi and bbq chicken with sweet chilli sauce (I can hear my family and Kristen licking their lips with jealous hunger! ;-)  I have more funny cab adventures coming soon (I know, I really have to stop taking cabs), but now it's time to go to bed. I'm laughing over my two most recent purchases at the book store.... 1)  After the Darkest Hour: How Suffering Begins the Journey to Wisdom  and  Foundations of Clinical Psychiatry .  There's no need to worry folks, I'm A-OK...the first book takes a very Buddhist perspective on life/philosophy/chaos/fate/luck etc. which is pretty interesting because it's obviously very different to what I believed when growing up. The clinical psych book is a good reference book...I swear I'm not trying to classify the crazies I meet as I'm walking down the street - alas they don't make a purse-sized version of this book just yet ;-)  I was going to tell some Halloween tales of old, i.e. trick or treating stories and fond memories of scaring the crap out of poor unassuming  trick or treaters, but maybe tomorrow!  Don't forget to brush your teeth, kids!
