Trying to climb up that ol' family tree...   So I moved 10,000 miles to get away from my family and now I'm trying to track down long lost relatives in Australia. Go figure! JUST KIDDING, GUYS! Okay, well, I'm not kidding about the tracking down relatives thing, but I was just joshing about moving all the way here to get away from you :-)  It's only taken nearly 4 years of nagging from dear Auntie Kate to really get me doing my research now. Over the years I have been collecting names and addresses of people with the last name Rahilly living in Oz. There are quite a few, but not  that  many. It's not an impossible number. But I haven't contacted any of them yet.   So hey, if your last name is Rahilly, and you live in Oz,  urlLink let me know  and we'll compare notes to see if we might be related. ;-)  During my first hardcore night of family tree research  I found a woman I am pretty darn sure is a relative - or it sounds likely at least. From what she's written, it seems like her grandfather and my great-granmother may have been siblings. I'm not sure where she lives, but she's also looking for her Australian Rahilly relatives, so if our stories work out right, then maybe we can help each other. Haven't heard back from her yet though - but here's hoping.   I also accidentally stumbled across a really cool idea for a story, based on the messages in the bulletin boards I was reading about Rahilly. Something that I read there really shocked me and I'm going to use it as the inspiration for a story...inspiration really does happen in the unlikeliest of places!   Impending Trip Home   Yes, yes, I'll be making my pilgrimage back to ye olde United States in about a month's time. Springfield or BUST! :-) As soon as I have details, I'll let you guys know. Well, I have to let my parents know first or they'll never let me hear the end of it! :-)
