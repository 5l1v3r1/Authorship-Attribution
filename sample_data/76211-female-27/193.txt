urlLink    The 'Cairns Adventure' Pics   Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I'm behind in blogging for the umpteenth time as usual. I suck, I know. But in the meantime, here are way too many pics from our  urlLink Cairns Photogallery . ;-) Highlights (for me, anyway) include some (what else?) butterfly pics from Oz Butterfly Sanctuary, some views from the Kuranda sky-rail, pics of my dad's muddy socks/shoes from our rainforest adventure, me looking like a smurf or a Blue Man Group wannabe in my blue wetsuit, some coral/fish shots of Aguincourt Reef, me in the bikini I thought would give my dad a stroke, and my dad and I pretending to work out at the gym in our resort. :-)   urlLink   Just a quick note to say I really got a good laugh from my Auntie Kate's email saying that if she ever comes to visit me in Oz, that I can leave 'all that nature stuff' out - she just wants to be pointed to the gift shops and the beaches, she says ;-)  p.s. I spoke to Miss Kristikeet last night and she was very pleased to know that my mother has taken a liking to her use of "meatloaf" to replace her sailor language. My mum has been trying to use it and I throw a meatloaf in my conversation every now and then, just to spice things up!
