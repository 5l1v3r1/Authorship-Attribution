Not quite Rugby...   So, tonight was the Rugby World Cup - Australia vs. England. Australians take their Rugby very seriously. So do the Brits. Lots of testosterone, lots of beer at the pub, team colours, big screen TVs tuned into the game, general craziness. And what did I do? I went to see ballet at the Opera House with Glenn. He's leaving Australia soon and I promised him I'd go see something at the Opera House with him before he left.   So we were laughing as we made our way to the Opera House, all dressed up in black, while everyone else on the bus was in green and gold or red and white.  We looked like the things in those children's books that didn't "belong" in the picture.  Anyway, the ballet was excellent. (We saw the Bella Trilogy.) I don't think I've been to a ballet since I was in high school. Glenn fell asleep during the first two performances, but he was wide awake for the last one. I really enjoyed the first two, but the last one just rocked. (Molto Vivace) It was beautiful and hilarious, with amazing set design, fun costumes, cute moves, lovely Handel music, great humour.   As we were getting up from our seats in the theatre, a little old woman walked by and yelled, "England and Australia are tied at 14!" As we were waiting for our bus we heards lots of cheering and screaming and were like, "CRAP! What is going on??? Who's scoring!???" England won it in the end. Bastards! ;-)  I just bought another book today even though I'm still getting through about 6 others...sigh...my book ADD is out of control...but I love my recent purchase - Amy Tan's  The Opposite of Fate . I was very close to getting Toni Morrison's  Love  or this book called  Seven Degrees of Ambiguity  by Aussie author Elliot Perlman. They both look wonderful, but Amy's won me over today.
