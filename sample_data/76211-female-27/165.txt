Stunned in Syney   I'm in shock. Two good friends of mine are in the middle of something terrible. Today I found out that one of them actually went through with a threat they had made. I can't believe it. What happens to people that they can go ahead and purposely hurt the people that they love the most?  It doesn't make sense - none of this makes sense. There was no reason for any of this to get ugly. No reason at all. And most of all, there is  no  acceptable excuse for this outcome.  None.
