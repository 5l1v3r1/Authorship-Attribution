Bon Voyage, Almost   Thanks to Ruth, Jorge, Ray, Glenn, Luke, David, Darren, Matthew, Damian, and Lisa for coming along to my 'farewell' dinner @ Flavour of India in Glebe. I had the Lamb Korma. Yum! I'm sure everyone is sick of me and all Lori-ed out from the past few weeks, but I appreciate the effort :-)  Tomorrow I have to ring my lawyer to find out all the bits I have to do for my visa application and I have to finally go and pick up my plane tickets. Oh yeah, I should start packing soon ;-)
