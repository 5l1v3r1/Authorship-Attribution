The Deadlys   Off to have dinner with Jorge @ Circular Quay and then we're going to see  The Deadly's  @ the Opera House with Craiggles. Should be another great night. If only I'd left a nice outfit here at work - now I have to go home and change. :(     The creepy face things you see are one of the weird things we found up in Newcastle over the weekend. I'd make a freakin' ugly alien, huh?
