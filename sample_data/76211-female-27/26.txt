It's going on 5am and Kristen and I just got home from Gavin's. He was such a sweetie and drove us home after a fun night out at Club 77 featuring Rumanastone and ESN. Okay the sun is going to be coming up soon and I must lay my head on the pillow before it does or I will feel like a vampire ;) More soon!
