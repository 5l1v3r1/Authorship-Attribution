And the Loser Lives On   Lori the Loser, that's me. It's 8pm, and what am I doing on my wild Friday night? I'm sitting in the office at work. D-O-R-K! I'm going to go home soonish...because I can work on much of this from there - woo-HOO!  I'm so fun and wild I can't take it anymore! And just when I think I can't get any more exciting, guess where I will be on Saturday and Sunday? You guessed it! Having more website fun! :-)  I'm not really bitter, just sleepy. ;-)  But I am going to go to the lovely Sal's b-day bash tomorrow night. Will be good to see everyone and I've promised Claudine I'd be her dance buddy.   Later taters!
