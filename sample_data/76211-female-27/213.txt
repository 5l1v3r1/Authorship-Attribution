Swimming to Class?   I'm about to head off to my freelance journo class - hopefully I'll be walking and not swimming - it has been pouring on and off all day in Syd - beginning this morning as I was trying to walk to work, with no umbrella and no raincoat. I was a good 15 minutes away from work when the downpour began and I realised that I would  never  get dry all day and should race back home, change, or grab new clothes to put on at work, put them in a plastic bag, and come back to work with a raincoat. However, just as I was about to head home, a tall 20-something woman came up to me and asked which way I was heading. I surprisedly said "Surry Hills" - and she said that was on her way and she proceeded to share her umbrella with me as we walked towards Surry Hills. That was all fine and dandy and incredibly fantastic of her until I realised that she was trying to pick me up. (A little of the, 'Are you seeing anyone? Would you like to meet up for a drink some time?" thing) Ooops! But, ummm, I couldn't let on that I wasn't at all interested in her and that I dig guys until I got closer to my office, due to the rain. I am evil, I know...but what the hell??? This is the second time a woman has hit on me in Sydney using an umbrella in a downpour. Weird. Do I give off some sort of "Lesbian Damsel in Rain Distress" vibe? I mean, it's all very flattering, but still...  Really looking forward to class tonight - should be good!
