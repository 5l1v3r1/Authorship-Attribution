Adios, Barcelona!   Desgraciadamente, anoche es mi ltima noche in Barcelona. Unfortunately, tonight is my last night in Barcelona. Im very disappointed to leave here. Had a blast on my last day including swimming and sunning myself (under many many applications of SPF 30 suncreen, mind you) at this incredible beach town called Sitge, which is 30 minutes out of Barcelona. Then I went back into the city to catch a bus to Montjuic and had a super cable car ride, giving me a lovely panoramic view of Barcelona from the sky. Ive seen Barcelona from nearly every angle now....from the highest point in Barcelona, Tibidabo, to the other side of the city @ Montjuic. I caught some amazing cacti gardens and was down at the Port once again, but from the other side. Im off to the hostel now, to shower as Im awfully disgusting....dinner, maybe some dancing....and then Im off on a train to Paris tomorrow morning. I leave for London on Tuesday morning, and arrive in New York Tuesday arvo and in Springfield Tuesday night.....its been an amazing time. Cant wait to write about it all properly when I get back!
