urlLink    BBQ, Barcelona, Movies, Dreams, Oh My   Briefly: Had my first Aussie BBQ on Saturday - fantastic. The Prime boys made their own Sausages and they were excellent! I begged them not to tell me what was in them or how they made them though. Thank you, Prime Sausage Factory!  I'm trying to put up some info/links to Barcelona for Jorge, Jamie, Robyn, and Rammstein, and I threw something together that is SO dodgy. I'll try to make it look bearable soon, but in the meantime, it's at:  urlLink http://barcelona2002.blogspot.com .  I saw  The Sweetest Thing  and  Signs  on Friday - more about that later....and I've set a new post-mid-year resolution for myself, more about that later too, and I apologise to C+C for completely bailing on Sunday. I didn't get home from the party until like 2 in the afternoon ooops.   Oh, and hopefully I'll have time soon to write about the dream I had last night - it's given me inspiration for a new fiction story...  Later!  p.s. The pic is of Sitges, a beach 40 mins outside of Barcelona, and where I wish I was right now! :-)
