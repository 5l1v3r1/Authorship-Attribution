I must be officially insane. I'm going out for the 3rd week night in a row...woo-hoo! Going to check out L'otel with Chad tonight to see all the 'Beautiful People.'  Maybe I should bring a mask? :)  Last night I went with C to the Hopetoun for some country and western. No really. It was a free gig and C was very persuasive so I figured, why not? This is coming from the person who got like a half an hour's sleep the night before. Stupid me.  So I paid for it this morning, but oh well....okay off to Town Hall now...couple of writing exercises online now...check 'em out if you're insanely bored, both written in 15 minutes and no-editing!   urlLink The Storm    urlLink Dignity
