She's baaaaaaaa-ack! (Well, almost!)   Welp, Heather has left Sydney and Kristen is just about to arrive. Leaving for the airport soon to get Miss Kristikeet and bring her back to my 1 star motel. :-) Can't believe she was just here 5 months ago - seems a lot longer than that! I'm so glad my 'central-heating' is working again, I was worried that I might get demoted to negative 0.5 star if my boarder shivered all night long! ;-)  So, the freak magnets will be together again within the hour - woo-HOO!  I'm off!!!           </Blog>
