Me so tired!   Oy...I'd love to tell y'all about my weekend in Melbourne and the Band Comp and meeting up with my Melbournite posse, but I'm too damn tired - maybe tomorrow? Gotta be up early - have to get my butt to the train station by 7.30 am to be at an early morning meeting about an hour away...wheeeeee!  Happy belated b-day to Dad!  Cheers! -Lozza :-)
