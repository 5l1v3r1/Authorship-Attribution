*YAWN* 1am   Just got home from work...wheeeee, I am SO glad to be sitting in my jammies. Have you ever worked on a project, where the longer you spent on it, the more confused you got? Well, that's what tonight was all about. I thought I was losing my mind...and I probably was, but now that I'm home, the sanity is starting to kick back in. It feels nice!  To stay sane, I used that hilarious Dubya link from yesterday as inspiration..we were going through all sorts of crazy site stuff and it got to the point where we just had to concentrate on  the  most important bits and so if we came across something non-crucial we'd quote Dubya and be like, "Do we care? WHATEVER!"  As long as I don't have nightmares about databases, I should sleep well tonight!
