Tonight was a night of comedy and pizza. I went to see the  urlLink Puppetry of the Penis  show at the Footbridge Theatre. Now now, I can hear my relatives freaking out from the other side of the world, but rest assured, this is a comedy show. Granted, you'd all still freak out if you ever saw it, but it was quite funny. I won't elaborate here, if you're curious, click on the link. So it was hilarious, even though I've seen it before - last year. I enjoyed it just as much this time around, and the support act was great too! I wish I could remember her name, but she rocked.  After the show we went to Otto's, one of my favourite Glebe cafes. I adore their chicken fajitas but Rammstein thought that the Tandoori Chicken pizza sounded good....to be continued....
