Butterfly Backpackers Fully Booked    Well, once again, my Butterfly Backpackers is open for business...Heather arrives tomorrow and then Kristen arrives on Sunday. This means that there will be a ton of story-telling, chocolate, and  Sex & the City  DVDs.&nbsp; I am very excited to seeing Buttercup and Kristikeet and all the girlie bonding that goes along with it. Kristen is bringing me a shitload of Hershey's chocolate. This makes me very happy. :-)   So I had a very lovely weekend...spent Friday night celebrating Ruth's birthday at the Lord Dudley Hotel in Woollahra and then Carlos and I headed back to the City...it's funny because I was thinking I'd be home in bed by about 12.30am but did not get to bed until about 6am as we went to eat, then went to Stonewall, the Colombian, and back to Stonewall for more dancing. We were thoroughly entertained by the bizarre collection of people at Stonewall. Comedy everywhere! Lots of drag queens-in-training who have a lot of work to do (hint: it's not a good look to have to hike up your pretend cleavage every 5 seconds!) and guys who were sadly dirty dancing with themselves up against a wall.&nbsp; I witnessed the first guy at Stonewall to ever take his shirt off and have patrons actually throw it back  at  him, asking him to put it back on! Heh!   I also got to catch up with Jorge, Kuan, Kevin, and Hussain on the weekend, which was fun except that it was hard to leave the hotel we were at because it was so freaking cold outside. Yes, I know, I am a total wuss.&nbsp; I am no longer a true New England Girl.&nbsp; 22 years of Massachusetts winters are all gone. I've totally gotten used to Sydney winters, and I now find them cold even though they're pathetic compared to what I grew up with.&nbsp;&nbsp;
