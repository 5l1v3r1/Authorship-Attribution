Just got back from Melbourne about 10 minutes ago...left Friday night and got back tonight (late Monlday night Sydney time) and I am ready to collapse. My feet are currently not speaking to me. I saw Angela, Dan, and Dave and met lots of new cool people. I'm ready for bed in every way. Update coming, in the words of Shakira, 'Whatever, Whenever' or something like that...
