urlLink    A 12-Year-Old Joni Mitchell  I've been told this photo of me playing guitar looks like a 12-year-old Joni Mitchell. Ahhh, if only I could play guitar even remotely like Joni. Alas, no. It's unfortunate as I have a really good guitar. If only its owner were up to par! My Lefty Ovation, my pride and joy. Must start practicing more! I am useless at parties though as I have forgotten all the songs I ever learned (with the exception of "Every Breath You Take" and "Blister in the Sun, " the latter of which I stumbled upon accidentally.) I only know how to play my own stuff, which makes me instantly useless at parties as obviously no one knows my crappy songs!  Oh, thanks to Ray, by the way, for scanning in the pic. This was part of his photography assignment for class.  Also, thanks to Claudine for a wonderful part the other night - lots of lovely people there!  Big  urlLink National Campus Band Competition  bummer - the NSW and VIC State finals are now happening on the same night, so I won't get to go to both. Looks like I'll just be heading down to the National Final in Melbourne at the end of October. In any case, head to a State Final near you if you are able - lots of funky bands cropping up this year!
