MERRY XMAS FROM PERTH   Just a really quick quickie - Perth is sunny and hot - I have just been walking around the city centre (it's a ghost town on Christmas, as I expected) and I ended up walking and reading along the Swan River...very nice and relaxing. I'm going to head to the beach later this arvo and probably stay to catch the sunset...going a bit later to avoid the harshest sun rays - I applied sunscreen like 5000x last year and still got burnt, so I'm trying to at least avoid the worst part of the day, sun-wise.  I am also just trying to stay awake. I did not go to bed last night, for fear that I'd sleep through my alarm, so I'm a zombie now!   The elevator in my building was broken when I went to call it to head down to my taxi which picked me up at 6.30am today. Thank goodness I wasn't IN the elevator when it broke down!!! That would be such a thing that would happen to me, but yay, it didn't! ;-)   I'm staying at a different hostel than last year - it is also fairly run down but it's much more quiet than the last one, only 4 people to a dorm room (yay!), the bathrooms/showers are so much closer to the actual rooms, and the place doesn't smell bad like the last one did. The only drawback is that office hours are only 8am-8pm, and that includes the internet cafe. *pout*  It's okay though because I could always just walk down the street to the last hostel and use their internet access - they're open 24 hours. Not that I intend to be online much, I really enjoy NOT checking the internet/email when I'm on holiday, but since I won't be able to blog while I'm on my  4 day tour, I figured I might as well post something. Besides, I have to check out what music gigs are happening in Perth tonight!  Mwah!
