urlLink    Shopping, Snoozing and Happy Belated Birthday to Me!   So it's a rainy Saturday afternoon, Heather is currently napping on my couch, and I'm about to go do some writing until we head out for dinner at my fave Mexican place, Cafe Pacifico. Mmmmm. Can't wait. I had pseudo-Mexican for lunch (Chilli con carne) but I'm looking forward to the real deal....I'm salivating already....  We went to the Glebe Markets this morning - Heather was ever so impressed that I got out of bed on my own, on a Saturday, at 9am. Even though there were lots of cute butterfly things taunting me at the markets, I showed a lot of restraint and did not actually buy anything. Besides, it's the end of the month, and I'm strapped for cash, as usual, so I have to be good!   urlLink   I know these pics are late, but I've finally uploaded a few photos from my birthday party last month.&nbsp; The first one Gavin took without my knowing, ooops! The second one is of me, Claude and Johnny. The last is of me, Owen, and Mer. Hilarious Retro madness! Never forget that "Walk Like An Egyptian" really is a great song for dancing!    urlLink    I've just been playing Heather some music I'm hoping she'll get into, namely the lovely  urlLink Gelbison  and my amazing future husband,  urlLink Jason Mraz . ;-)   A billion squillion thank-yous to my hero, Stevealicious, for sending me many live Jason Mraz CDs AND a Jason Mraz DVD. Yay! It's like Jason is performing for me in the comfort of my own bedroom every night!
