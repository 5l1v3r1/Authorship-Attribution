Just Say No!   I really need to learn how to lie faster sometimes...like whenever your boss asks you what you're doing over the weekend, you should  always   always  have definite plans so you are not available to do whatever he/she is about to ask you to do. Actually, in this case, I did have loose plans to go to the Sydney Writer's Festival on Sunday, but I'd already stupidly agreed to do this other work thing before I remembered.  So, this afternoon, I am going to a Rugby League Game @ the SCG and I have to take at least 10 good quality, useable, high res photos of fans. That in itself isn't too daunting. What's scary is that I also have to get everyone I take photos of to sign release forms saying they give us permission to use photos of them in advertisements in the Rabbitohs Supporters Magazine and on the Arrive alive website. So that means convincing anywhere from 10 to 50+ people to sign release forms. Oh, and of course, the other challenge is that there can't be any alcohol (beer) showing up in these photos. So I'm supposed to find the craziest, most dressed up fans. Bring on the Rabbitohs colours, bring on the facepaint, bring on crazy poses. I tried my damndest to bribe friends to come with me - but no one would come, not even with a free ticket. It's just as well, as it will be a lot easier to make a fool out of myself without a friend right there, laughing at me. Oh, and did I mention that it's POURING rain now? I am going to do my best, but I am definitely lacking confidence in myself. I suck at asking strangers to do things for me...but here's hoping that I am able to pull this off!   Oh, and what have I learned from this lesson? That I need to learn to say no much faster. I am hereby officially 'busy' every other weekend from here on in ;-)
