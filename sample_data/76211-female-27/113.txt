I'M BAAAAAAAA-AAAAACK!   So, I'm back in Sydney. Ooops, my blog has finally been 'fixed' - now all the posts I was trying to make are showing up. OOps! I'll have to go back and delete all that crap. I actually started a new blog temporarily as I was so frustrated I couldn't post to this one. Not that anyone saw it!
