Dancing Till the Sun Comes Up...   I pretty much did this at Owen and Clive's party on Saturday. We had the pleasure of being DJ'd to by another co-worker of mine and Owen's - good ol' Daniel. The Primes really now how to prepare a house for a party. They'd ingeniously covered all floors of the house with cardboard so there would be virtually no clean-up in the morning - just have to throw out the cardboard. Clive even thought to put down pieces of paper covered in trivia all over the house - very amusing!   Should have some pics of the party courtesy of Karin and Owen soon. Karin's got some terrible pictures of me dancing, ummm, terribly! ;-) I almost succeeded in going to a party without any embarassing event happening until someone walked in on me peeing - even though I had locked the door. I was not counting on someone having a key to the door! Sigh...  Except for that horrible moment, the rest of the evening was heaps of fun. Thanks to the Prime boys for being such good hosts and thanks to Dan for the tunes!
