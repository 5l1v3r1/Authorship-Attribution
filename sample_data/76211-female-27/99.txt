See ya, Sydney   I leave for the airport in less than an hour.....auuuugggghhh! In a few hours I'll be on a plane to NYC...and I'll arrive 23 sweet hours later. I'll still have e-mail while I'm away, so feel free to say hi @  lori@butterflynet.tv .  Quick messages: Rach & Ant: Can't wait to see you! Friday, baby! Javier: Can't believe we're reuniting in Barcelona - could it be any better? Jorge: Tell me all about the amazing move. Dramas, tragedies, etc. Shay: My netscape crashed while composing your informative email...will re-send it from Springfield. Shay & Sal: Will email you the details on, well, you know, that other stuff. Rammstein: Good luck with everything, and have an amazing time, you little World Traveller ;-) The Sheas, McGuires, Colsons, Cullens: See you SO soon! Can't wait! Fidelma: Hope you get lots of writing done! Chad: I expect your blog any day now!  Kristen: You, me, and Foxwoods, baby! So excited! I'll call you on Tuesday!  And there are about a thousand other messages I want to send, but must resume cleaning! I've done everything to procrastinate cleaning - even have gone so far as to fill out my exit Australia pass! How sick am I!  Next blog coming in about 30 hours....Springfield or Bust!
