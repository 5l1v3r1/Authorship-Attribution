Happy Birthday to Me!   Happy Birthday to ME! Happy Birthday to ME! Happy Birthday dear MEEEEEE! Happy Birthday to ME!  I am 26....oy. I'm not liking 26 in the sense that it seems a hell of a lot closer to 30 than 25...but so far, so good ;-)  Thank you to all my fantastic friends and family who sent me birthday wishes (in person or electronically) or gifts or phone calls or anything! You guys all rock!  Will update soon!
