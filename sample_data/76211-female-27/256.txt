M.ardi G.ras Update + Summer Don't Go, Please!   Okay, so just a quick update on the National Nine News footage of me carrying the "P.REGNANT L.ESBIANS" sign....several friends did see me...here's what one of them said went down on the news:  ---------  Email from Tam:   "It was so funny - they just showed different footage, and the story was like 'there was everything including politicians, raunchy costumes, and pregnant lesbians' at which point they showed you carrying the sign proudly! :) They actually singled you out as one of the features of the parade!  You looked like you were really proud, with head held high, carrying the sign!  It was priceless!"  ----------  Oh yes, priceless! I was dying of laughter when I got this email from Tam. Too funny.  I am so going to have to try to get a copy of this from Channel 9. Even though I was only on for a 10th of a second, it's just too funny to pass up. It's definitely something entertaining to show the grandkids one day ;-)  Ok and I know it was pretty damn hot today, but it made me happy because I was worried we were going to go into Autumn way too quickly. This past weekend was rainy and cooler and crappy and I was bummed...but it is now after 6pm and it's just over 39 degrees C or 102 degrees F. Should make for quite a sweaty Pilates class tonight - there's no air-con in the school where I am taking the class.  It's only supposed to be in the 70s the rest of the week...I know that's lovely, but I think I'm a low 80s sorta gal!  Oh yes, that's right...I am taking a pilates class and a belly dancing class now...this will be 6th pilates class tonight and my 5th belly dancing class on Thursday...tales of how un-coordinated and inflexible I am coming soon...I may suck but at least I am having fun!
