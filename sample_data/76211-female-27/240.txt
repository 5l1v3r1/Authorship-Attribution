Happy Birthday, Daddums!   Happy Birthday, Dad!   "Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to youuuuuu,  Happy Birthday dear Daddummmmmms Happy Birthday to you..."  *Note, no, I do not actually generally refer to my father as Daddums, it's just a bit of fun for his birthday.   Congrats, Dad, you are finally as old as Patrick Swayze ;-)   p.s. Would it be rude to be all excited that the Marlins beat the Yankees in the World Series on my dad's birthday when my dad is a huge Yankee's fan? Yeah, I guess it would. Okay, I won't say anything about being excited then ;-)
