Slumber Party!   Just a note to any fam or friends who might try to ring me this weekend from the States - don't bother trying my home phone because I won't be there! I'll be spending the weekend 'out west' with Claudine and Miss Mia. Bring on the rented movies, yummy food, gossip, dancing, story telling, facials, make-up etc. Claudine has begged me to let her do my make-up...she mentioned 'eye-lash curler' so I'm slightly frightened. All I wear is lipstick, so it should be an educational weekend in that respect!  Ooooh, we should get some raw cookie dough a la Kristikeet & Lorikeet! :D  Big belated thanks to Brian who is the sweetest thing ever and mailed me a HUGE bag of Hershey's chocolate. Bless you! :D
