Happy Bizarre Anniversary To Me   Today is the 16th Anniversary of the day I broke my arm due to being forced into a game of tag against my will and running into a door.   I was 9.   The game of tag was the idea of an Evil Girl from Springfield. If I've ever had an actual 'nemesis' - this was the girl. It's okay though because my soon-to-be finished novel based on her will be a big hit and then it's only a matter of time before it's turned into a movie and everyone will get to see this little nightmare in action. Of course, I will donate a large portion of the novel/movie earnings to a worthy children's charity. ;-)  Here's to 16 years of me being a relatively accurate meteorologist - I can feel the rain in my bones! Hehe - 'accurate meteorologist' - that's the funniest oxymoron I've used in ages! :D
