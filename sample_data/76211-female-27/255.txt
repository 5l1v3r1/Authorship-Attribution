Yes, yes, I am still alive and well, getting close to coming out of my bloggerly hibernation....Happy Valentines Day to all of you who care....i.e. all of you who are not single ;-)   Just about to hop in the shower, but I just had to say..   WTF?? HUH?     urlLink Bush Nominated for Nobel Peace Prize   Yeah, okay! Fabulous idea!!!! Not at  all  insane or anything!!!  Anyway, the scoop is that work has been super busy and Miss Kristikeet is in town and we've been having a blast. We've had plans nearly every night for the last week and a half - crazy, but fun!
