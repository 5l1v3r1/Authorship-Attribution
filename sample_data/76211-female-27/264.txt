Chillin' in the Gong...   Spent most of today down in Wollongong taking photos for the Uni Games. It was just one of those days....the train was late and stopped several times along the way, so it took a little over two hours to get there.   I'd memorised the sports schedule on the way down and had my itinerary all set up. Unfortunately two of the sports were finished by the time I arrived at 1.30 (even though they were supposed to go until 5pm) so I was only able to cover Badminton, Water polo, and Ultimate Frisbee. I took about 300 photos but alas, digital cameras aren't really meant for action shots so I got a ton of blurry shots. Ooops.   Ah well, what can you do. I'm just happy that I spent so much time in the presence of flying objects and did not get hit in the head once! Yay! Usually flying objects gravitate towards my head, so I got off lucky.   I did some writing on the way back home on the train and this little old man told me he was sure I was going to be a famous writer one day. Oh, if only ;-)
