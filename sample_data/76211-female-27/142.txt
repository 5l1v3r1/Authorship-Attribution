Kids Today   Just a very quick quickie. On Saturday night I did indeed go see iOTA and Ben Kweller (USA). The funniest thing were these cute little teenagers waiting to get into the venue next to us. A boy and a girl. They looked all of 16 but were probably 18. They were so excited, they looked ready to burst. The boy turned to me and said, "Are you here to see Ben Kweller or iOTA?" and I said "Both." I thought his face was going to break from the huge smile on his face. He was beaming. He searched for the perfect response to my answer..."RAD!" he yelled. Hahahahahaha! I was laughing so hard. I have not heard anyone say "Rad!" in so long.   Anyway, it was nice to see such enthusiasm - he didn't appear to be on anything either, so yay! We ended up sitting with these little punks, who looked like they were in heaven...more about everything later - I gotta get home to see  24 ! I got my priorities straight, alright!  Thanks to the McGuires for actually taking the time to read through my looooooooooooong entries! ;-)
