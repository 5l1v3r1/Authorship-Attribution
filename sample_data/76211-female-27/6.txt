I will go back and fill in the last few days later, but even though my weekend got off to a rough start (i.e. Friday night was hellish), this turned out to be the most fun weekend I've had in probably a year. This weekend I learned so much and met some of the coolest people of all time and I had some of the best conversations and I did a lot of writing....funny how it was the best weekend in ages, yet I didn't get to sleep in at all ;) More coming soon!
