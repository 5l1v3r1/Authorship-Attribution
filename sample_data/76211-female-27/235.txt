Home Sweet Home   So, I'm back in my  other  home now, Sydney.  I'd just like to thank the weather-gods for the lovely WARM/hot weather these last couple days. I seriously feel like I've been gone for like 6 months. The 3 weeks at home just FLEW by. I definitely did not have enough time to see everyone and do everything. :( But when I got back here, I felt like 6 months had passed instead of just 3 weeks. WEIRD.  One question I kept getting by friends and family was whether or not I have a boyfriend now. I disappointed everyone as usual when I said, "NUP!" and I kept saying, "Um, yeah, it's safe to say that I'm not staying in Australia for my love life. I'm living in the freaking gay capital of the world." They were like, "Really? Is it really the gay capital of the world? Are you sure you're not just being overly dramatic?"  Well now I have proof!  urlLink Australia 'world's gayest country'   See? I TOLD ya so! ;-)  Anyway, just goes to show that I must really like Sydney as it's not the hot and available straight men that are keeping me around ;-)
