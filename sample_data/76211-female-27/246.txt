Happy Anniversary to Me   Today marks the 4 year anniversary of me living in Australia. FOUR FREAKIN' YEARS. I cannot believe it. It's all gone by so quickly. It's 6 am and I just got home a little while ago from a night out with Chad, Claudine, Amanda, and other gang members. Okay, I was going to write a blog, but now I can't keep my eyes open...good night/good morning whatever!
