Poor little blogger has been down for maintenance. I really wanted to post early last night and then when I got home from last night, but I had to be a patient little butterfly. Blogger is a free service and it's freaking cool, so who am I to whinge if every so often I have to be patient?  Anyhoo, I have loads to catch up on....
