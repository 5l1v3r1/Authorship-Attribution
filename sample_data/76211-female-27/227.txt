They're back!  What the hell is underneath the road outside my apartment that's so important that they need to make so much noise and work on it late at night? Is there gold under there or something? ;-) Tonight I'm going to try keeping a CD on repeat and see how that blocks things.   Web Savvy Relatives?  So I had my phone off at work today, but the father of the boy who rang me from Brisbane last night left a message. He was just confirming again that the woman I named in my letter was in fact his mother. He said he would fax the letter to her and that she would probably get back to me "via email because she's right into that stuff!" Hahahahaa! She's got to be in her 70s and she's right into the email. I love that! But he also mentioned the suburb she lives in up in Queensland and I think I sent a letter directly to her as well - in any case, all bases are covered there. This guy said his mum would have a lot more information for me. Very exciting!  Just got home from work, so I'm exhausted and googly-eyed. Can't believe that I'll be heading to Chicago/Springfield/Boston in less than two weeks! Crazy!
