Happy Easter in Advance!   Happy Easter to all my friends and family celebrating it this weekend. I'm off to Byron Bay this weekend - yayayayayayayayay! Big thanks to Jamie for being oh so helpful in regards to Byron!  I leave tomorrow night and I won't be back until Tuesday - I'm really looking forward to it. But NOT looking forward to the 13 hour bus ride (each way) - *sob* It's funny cause I was reading the journal I kept the last time I was there and I specifically wrote, in all capital letters, I VOW TO NEVER TAKE THE BUS TO BYRON BAY AGAIN! Funny how you can find yourself eating your words - I REALLY would rather fly, but it's so much cheaper to take the bus, and well, there you go. Don't worry, Mum & Dad, I'm not intending to go sky-diving this time - but only because I can't afford it ;-)   Anyhoo, I've hopefully learned enough from last time to make this trip a bit better. I'm bringing three sweatshirts and a blanket (it was freezing last time, people actually got into their sleeping bags on the bus!), and I'll have lots of snacks and water - and the snacks will hopefully not be too garlicky or oniony so as to scare anyone  (including myself) with my dreamy breath. And I'm bringing a tooth brush  & paste in my ON-BOARD luggage this time, my CD-player and batteries, an eye mask,  and I'm buying sudafed to knock myself out as i have problems sleeping upright. And I'll pray that I don't get the only seat that doesn't recline this time. 13 hours...it's basically like flying from Sydney to L.A.!  I do hope to get that floatation tank/massage package that I got last time though...I'll need it after the bus-ride! I'm so looking forward to relaxing on the beach - hopefully I won't run into Leslie Nielson this time ;-)  Love to the Sheas, McGuires, Colsons, Cullens, Laczeks, Shea-Roberts, Downies, etc.   I'm outtie! :D
