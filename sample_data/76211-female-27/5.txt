It will probably be the weekend before I catch up! Grrrrr! :)  Worked late again tonight after vowing to leave at a reasonable hour. Silly me. Anyhoo, am going to do my daily writing exercise shortly, so this will be quick. Just want to send out my condolences to the victims/families of the latest plane crash in New York. It must be extra freaky for poor little New Yorkers since all that's happened in the last couple months. :(  Going to see John Butler Trio tomorrow night ! Woo-hoo! Verrry excited about that!  Sweet dreams!
