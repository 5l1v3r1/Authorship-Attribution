The Lollie-Lama   That's me, I'm now the Lollie-Lama (not to be confused with the Dalai Lama, as if anyone could....) Last night I treated Shay to some lollies at the Hoyts @ Fox Studios in honour of his birthday on Saturday. On Sat, I was in the Blue Mountains hiking my totally un-physically fit butt off. Anyway, Happy Belated B-day to  urlLink  Shay  and to Owen. We watched Lord of the Rings last night - loved it! I want to live in the Shire in Bilbo Baggins' house! And now that it's legal to love Elijah Wood, life is good...  Happy Belated Easter and all that Jazz.  This is just a quick note to say I'm alive...much catching up to to!
