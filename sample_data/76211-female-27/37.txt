p.s. Viruses suck. I hope the computer viruses I received at 1.02 am this morning aren't a sign of how 2002 is going to progress! I've got about 12 infected files on my computer. If you've received anything with an attachment from me in the last 24 hours, please delete it. It's a weird little virus that, amongst other things,  sends out randomly named files to people. My mother received a file called "Nude Me" and I was horrified. Just delete, people. Just delete! I apologise for the annoyance! If you successfully downloaded the file by accident, do a google search for "Badtrans" cleaning utilities. I've got Badtrans.B.Trojan and Badtrans.B.Worm.  Lovely.   Happy New Year (Again) Hope you're all happy and healthy and well!
