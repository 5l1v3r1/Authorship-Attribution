MERRY CHRISTMAS!   Merry Christmas, gang! Thanks heaps to my family for sending my wonderful Xmas care package! I love everything my parents sent me (they rock!!!) and big thanks to Auntie Kate for the lovely butterfly necklace (I wore it tonight to my Xmas Eve party!) and the pic/frame.  I leave on Christmas Day for Perth - I'll be checking email at the beginning and end of my trip, but there will be 4 days in there that I will be on a tour, so probably won't be able to get online then.   On Boxing Day I'll be going to Rockhingham, which is an hour south of Perth, for what will hopefully be my first viewing of dolphins in the wild.....it's a childhood dream that I am hoping will happen this time around!  Merry Christmas to everyone! I you want to email me, the best address would be:  urlLink butterflynet@ekno.com   Huge thanks to Schmoopie + Anthony for the Christmas Card, I will ring you guys in the New Year, when I get back to Syd!!! Happy holidays, guys!  And thanks to Claud, Fleur, Diane, Lisa, Rachael, etc, for their cards/gifts too! Mwah!  Merry Christmas to Jav - hope you have a wonderful time partying in Springfield ;-) Let me know how long you will be there! (k) x 10000000!  Happy Wedding to Tania & Chris!!!  Merry Christmas to Kristikeet and her lovely mum (not me, her other mum!) - I will call you when I get back! Mwah! Cluck! Cluck!  Merry Christmas to the Sheas, Laczeks, McGuires, Colsons, Cullens!  Love you all! B-fly  p.s. A few of you have reminded me not to get myself  urlLink trapped in a bathroom on a moving boat  again this year - as if I need reminding! Trust me, I never want to do that again!
