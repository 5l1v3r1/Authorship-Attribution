Just a quickie to confirm I have not actually fallen off the planet   So excited for yet another long weekend. Australia rules! :-)   Going to see Radiohead tonight - yay! I've always wanted to see them live and finally it's gonna happen! I really really hope they play "Let Down" - I think that's my favourite Radiohead song, though it's hard to choose.   Tomorrow I'm going to see "Lost In Translation" - finally. Just when I thought I was the only one I knew who hadn't seen it yet, a friend confessed he had missed it as well, so we're gonna go before the movie stops playing.  Tomorrrow night it's another Big Blue party - a night of dancing to raise money for the Make a Wish Foundation - should be good.   After that - just catching up with friends - I hope to catch up on sleep, writing, and the little domestic issues I've been neglecting like tidying up the apartment and doing laundry.   Well, this has been quite a boring blog. But at least my family will know I am still alive!  Smooches! me
