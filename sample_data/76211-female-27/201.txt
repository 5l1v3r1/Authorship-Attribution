I Wanna Go Home!   It's going on 9.30pm and I'm still at work...can not  wait to go home. I'm so sleepy. I have the world's babiest cold. Like it's the best cold I've ever had - I just have a headache and am sneezy. That's a wuss of a cold if I've ever had one - and I'm fine with that. I bought some cold medicine at lunch time cause I couldn't stop sneezing though, and let me tell you, it did not help my job performance. It helped the sneezing, but not my thought processes. I was having issues working on this one website because in my cold-medicine drugged up state I kept wrongly naming pages and then of course, referring to those wrongly named pages. DOH! Silly butterfly!  Last night I worked late-ish and I was being rushed out the door by my boss who was leaving, and I had just sent this batch of files file etc, then I went to dinner with Jorge, feeling less stressed since I had just sent off that project I was frantically working on last night. So you can imagine my horror when I get home around 11pm to find out that my file was rejected by the recipient - too big. It wasn't  that  big, but too big for him, so I had to get into my sent-mail and re-send each powerpoint presentation separately, which would have been no big deal if I were at work, but since I was at home on my slow-ass dial-up connection, it took like a half hour to send each file. I was up pretty late late, but the dude did get his files, just later than he expected!   I'm currently emailing clients a 15 MB file...any bets on if it'll go through? ;-)
