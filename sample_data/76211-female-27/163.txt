Happy Anniversary to Me   Today marks my 3 year anniversary in Australia. THREE years! I cannot believe I've been here that long. THREE bloody years. Geez, time flies by fast....now my family will remember these last three years as the QUIETEST years of their life, with chatterbox Lori out of the country. As one of my co-workers used to say, I 'can talk under water' ;-)  I do miss you guys (talking about my family and old friends here) - all I can say is, appreciate the silence while you can!
