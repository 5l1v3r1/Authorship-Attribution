Sorry for all the damn dots lately. I have been way too tired to write much recently. And I'm not going to do much better tonight - perhaps this Sunday I will actually catch up on the last week. For now I'll just give a minor update on last night's dinner. Gav is a legend for suggesting that dinner. It was TO DIE FOR. Red curry barrimundi. Holy cow, that was amazing. My taste buds were in heaven. Between the tandoori pizza last week and the barrimundi this week, my stomach has been very very very happy. Oh, for you guys in the U.S. , barrimundi is a white fish like haddock or scrod. My family would love the actual barrimundi, but hate the red curry. I am the freak spice lover in the family!  Anyway, Gav has challenged me to choose an even better place for dinner next time we go out, and I'm feeling pretty intimidated, but I did introduce him to  urlLink John Butler , so I've got that going for me!    urlLink Homebake  is happening on Saturday...it's going to be awesome, though difficult to choose between simultaneous acts...stay tuned!
