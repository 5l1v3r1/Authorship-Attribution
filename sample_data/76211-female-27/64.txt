All the V in the World Couldn't Save Me Now   I'm just  that  tired. And I have Chaos class tonight. Any type of class/lecture would be non-conducive to me staying awake tonight....oy. More on my V revelations later... ---- The good news is that I had steak and mashed potatoes today for lunch! And I survived - no problem. I'm going to try to eat red-meat twice a month now so I never have to experience that lovely 5am Sunday morning rude awakening ever again! :)
