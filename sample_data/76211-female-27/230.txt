I'm off!  Well, almost...just about ready to head to the airport. I want to get there early so I can flirt with whoever it takes to get an aisle seat! I will be as shameless as I have to be! I don't care - anything to increase my chances of getting that aisle seat  (fingers crossed!) It's 20 hours of flying time, so I'm not too proud to beg! ;-)   Boston Peeps  I will be in Boston on the 3rd and 4th of September - Wed + Thurs. Will ring you guys on Monday. I get in to Hartford/Spfld on Sunday night cause I have to stay over one night in Chicago.    Springfield Peeps  See you soon! :D
