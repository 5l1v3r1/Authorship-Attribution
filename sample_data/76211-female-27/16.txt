One thing I will never get over: The cleaning ability of Sprite. I'm sure club soda would work just as well, but I never have that lying about. But yeah, if you happen to spill dark juice or soda on your carpet because you or your friends are klutzes, just pour enough Sprite on the carpet to cover the entire stain. Let it soak in....then start to mop it up with a sponge and put a fan over the rug to assist in the drying. If you use enough Sprite, the stain should be either totally gone or at least 100x better than it was before. I'm about as un-Martha Stewart as they come, but at least I know one trick ;)
