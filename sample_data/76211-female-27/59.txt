My computer is dead. I think. Work has been insane. Clients have been insane. I might be going insane. Yap died. Yap was resurrected. I thought I had lost over a year's worth of articles, but not yet. However I think I've lost the rest of my home computer files. I now want to write everything in a paper notebook and never use a computer again. Which is bad considering my job. Too much to write, too much to say. Not enough time. Left work around 11.30pm last night, if that gives you any indication.  Going out for girls night out tonight. Thank bloody goodness!  Happy Mardi Gras for tomorrow.   If my computer is dead, won't update again until at least Monday!  p.s. Go see  urlLink Shay's  awesome Oscar tipping thingymabob! Go Shay! p.p.s. Thanks to Sal for taking the awesome aussie pic of me, Shay, and Kristen. Will be posted asap!
