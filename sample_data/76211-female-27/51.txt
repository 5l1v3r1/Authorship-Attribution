Go Patriots!   I was as baffled as the next New Englander that the Patriots actually made it into the Superbowl, nevermind that they actually won! Maybe this means there's hope for the Chicago Cubs one day too! Anyway, go home team!  I'm actually really disappointed I didn't get to see the Superbowl entertainment, particularly U2's performance. The tribute to the Sept. 11th victims sounds awfully moving and I can just imagine the crowd going wild when Bono opened his jacket to reveal stars and stripes. My friend who died on Sept. 11th in the WTC was a huge fan of Bono and U2. I hope she heard them singing to her today. We miss you, my friend.
