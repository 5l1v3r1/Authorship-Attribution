The REAL Hardcore Gang Members   Okay, the official verdict is in - the last remaining HARDCORE troopers for Sal's Hen's Party and Shay's Bucks Party were: me, Claudine, Chad, and Bart. It is 7.30am and we all just got home. We just had breakfast at McDonalds because that's all that was open at 6.30am. Granted, Shay, Sal, and Chris and Chantal all left slightly earlier for good reasons, but I feel like the last 4 of us won Survivor or something!  Anyway, it was hilarious and fun evening and I look forward to seeing the pics. Lots more to blog about, but now me needs to sleep! I hate going to bed when it's light and sunny out!
