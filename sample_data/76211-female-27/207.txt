More ways to procrastinate from writing my novel...   Well, if I'm going to procrastinate from writing the old novel, at least I'll be doing it by writing. I got into my freelance journalism course - yay! It starts next week. It's always full whenever I try to register for it, but not this time, dammit! I've had ideas for articles floating around for ages and I'm hoping the deadlines for assignments set during the course (one every week) will motivate me to FINISH SOMETHING for once, dammit! And of course I'm doing this in 'crunch' time. I know it sounds silly, but I was hoping to have my first novel (ha!) finished (at least a draft of it) while I was still 25 and I'll be 26 in just over a month...and considering I'm NO WHERE close to that goal, of course I go and sign up for a class ;-) Typical Lori. Oh well, just gotta do the best I can.  In the meantime, if anyone has any burning questions to ask the comedian  urlLink Jimeoin , hurry up and  urlLink email me  as I'm interviewing him tomorrow. Personally, I think he's just putting on the accent....kidding, kidding.  Oh, I had wonderful Spanish Tapas tonight at my favourite Tapas place in Glebe with Rammstein - yum! And thanks to the awesome Rammstein I now have a functional phone! YAYAYAYAYAY! It vibrates! I can hear callers in public! I can hear calls in public! I now have predictive text! I have a calendar/organiser! It's all very exciting! Of course I was trying to show off and send Rammstein a text message after he left and screwed it up and sent him 2 blank messages instead, so I have a bit more practicing to do....ooops!   Sweet dreams!
