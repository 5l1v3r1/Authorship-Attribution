School Rocks!   My class was fantastic. I love the teacher - he is so hilarious and he seems really positive. He is realistic - he's confirmed what we already knew - that getting published (and paid) ain't a piece of cake because there's plenty of competition out there - but it's all about persistence and cranking those stories out. We all did the 'go around the room, introduce ourselves, and explain what we do, where we're from, and what we want out of the class' thing. That's normally a tedious thing, but it must be done and we did pretty well. It seems like a very interesting and diverse group, so that's cool. There are 20 of us, and it's fairly equal in the gender area - if anything, there are more males, which is quite different from the writing classes I normally take.  We had a brief writing exercise which involved just listing interesting or non-interesting things about ourselves. My list made people laugh - sorry, that's all I'm going to reveal here! Anyhoo, I'm very inspired - yay!
