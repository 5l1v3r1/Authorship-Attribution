Piatas, baby!   God I love  urlLink Dave Barry . He is my hero.  Check out his wonderful  urlLink Art of piata bashing  piece. I laughed so hard I nearly snorted...and it made me think back fondly to the time my cousins had a piata for someone's birthday and some male cousins were alluding to the fact that I was a) weak b) a girl and c) a weak girl and that I'd never put a dent on the piata. I was like, "oh YEAH? We'll see about that!" And I went nuts with the whacking. Not only did I crack the piata open, it actually went flying across the room. And even more impressive, I must have had a burst of adrenaline when I was swinging because I put a hole in the ceiling. Ooopsies. I was annoyed though because by the time I got the blindfold off, my other cousins had already stuffed most of the candy into their pockets. Bastards. Not that I'm bitter or anything. *flexing big bulging butterfly biceps* :D
