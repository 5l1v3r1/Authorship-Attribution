Star Wars, Birthdays, Visas, Oh My!   First up, a HUGE thank you to Rammstein for inviting me to the Star Wars Premier at Fox Studios. Lovin' the VIP treatment and seats! More about Star Wars later, but I had such a fantastic time, it was just what the doctor ordered that night!  BIG BIG BIG Happy Birthday to Fan Man aka Chad! (And to his baby brother too!) Sorry, the cake I was supposed to jump out of was run over by a bus. Don't ask... ;-) (I'm kidding, Mum!)  And to those of you wondering what's going on with the whole visa thing - your guess is as good as mine! As soon as I know anything concrete, I'll let you know.  Off to celebrate the birthdays now - yay!  Oh, and I'm finally doing the Sydney Harbour Bridge Climb on Sunday. 'Bout bloody time!  And I'm outtie! (Yes, another pathetic quickie, I know!)
