I HEART WA!   Wow. Just got back from my 4 Day Tour to Monkey Mia and I just can't get over what an amazing time I had. Our tour guide was wonderful and hilarious and the people on the tour were a lovely bunch. It was a pleasure to hang out with them all these last 4 days. As our bus  drove back into Perth today, it was a shock to the system to see the city. It was a strange sight and my first reaction was, "Man, can't we just go back to where we were?" Who knew that Lori, Little Miss Cityslicker, would adjust so quickly to the country/small town living?   I am too tired to write too much tonight. I have to go put my Nurofen Gel on my poor sore legs now - my legs are sore from the rock climbing we did two days ago (I am in crap shape!)  and I know they'll be feeling the sand dune climbing we did today. I really need to start exercising - I can't expect to be a lazy ass and then not have my muscles rebel when I actually use them -  but yeah - the short  story (which is rare from me) is that I had a brilliant trip and I am so disappointed I don't have more time in Western Australia. I really want to go do the  top  northwest and the bottom southwest of WA! If only I could find someone to sponsor these trips. ;-)  Tomorrow is my last day in WA and then I'm back on a plane to Sydney....I arrive at 7am  on New Year's Day - so I'll be on a plane on New Year's Eve...so no parties for me, but the plane ticket was MUCH cheaper, so it makes sense...maybe they'll give us champagne on the plane! A girl can  dream...  I am now pining away for the small towns/country/farm stay - who knew!??
