Cricket Happy   I'm off to bed now, but just wanted to give a big shout out to team Australia for putting on such a good game today. The Aussies rocked. I'm bummed that their win was not enough to see them through to the end, but it was a great match, as well as a crazy one. A lot of fairly rare things happened and even a poor seagull died after being hit in the head with a ball. :(  Many many thanks to  urlLink Shay  and Sal for being such superb hosts and teachers! Kristen and I spent the day with them, along with Chad (Hi, Chad, O Loyal Reader) and Andy. It was a lot of fun and I have a ton of respect for the game of cricket. Holy cow, it's WAY more complicated and involved than I'd ever imagined. Obviously, I still have a lot to learn, but I know enough to be able to keep up now without a blank stare! (Thanks, Shay!) We learned a lot today and I'm looking forward to the next game!   More about the day later, I need to sleep!!!
