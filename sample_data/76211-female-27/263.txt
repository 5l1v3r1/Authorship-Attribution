All Hail to the King   So I was waiting for a fried egg, cheese, and BBQ sauce sandwich at the corner shop on Monday and the place was packed. There was a dad in there with his three kids, who were 10, 8, and 6. They were all having brekkie and were so funny to watch. They all wanted a bit of each other's food and were making deals with each other, i.e. "If you give me 2 more strawberries from your fruit salad, I'll let you have as many bites as you want from my bacon & egg sandwich!"  So cute!  Anyway, the father starts telling this guy at works at the shop that it's the 50th anniversary of Elvis' hit "That's Alright" (or something like that) and starts belting it out, VERY loudly. Everyone in the shop was looking amused or alarmed. It might have been a bit too early in the morning for that much Elvis.   Steve, a guy who works at the shop was like, "Hey, Elvis, Lori is a Yankee! Lori, how was that Elvis impersonation, any good?" and I diplomatically said, "Yup, not bad! Not bad at all!"  I turn around to pay for my sandwich and the Elvis singer comes up behind me and hands me his card. He says, "I'm an Elvis impersonator! I do this for a living!" And sure enough, his card has a photo of him all dolled up as Elvis and says, "The Elvis Experience." Dear lord. I was a bit worried as while I thought he was "not bad" as a dad singing Elvis, I'm not sure how good he is if he's supposed to be an Elvis impersonator. But he obviously loves it and that's the main thing!   I kept his card. It's too funny.  I tried to imagine the kids at school chatting to other kids.   Kid 1: "My dad is a plumber!" Kid 2: "My dad is a mechanic!" Kid 3: "My dad is a doctor!" Kid 4: "My dad is an Elvis impersonator!"  ;-)
