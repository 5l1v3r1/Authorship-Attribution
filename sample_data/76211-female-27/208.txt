Okay, I admit it, I am a pervert...   I tell you, if I could be anywhere right at this very moment, it would be in the  Rove Live  studios. I adore the adorable Rove McManus on his own, but who else is on tonight? Matthew "Dimples" McConnaughey. Okay, so acting isn't his strong point, but dimples go a long way with me. And even more exciting is - my beloved Hugh Jackman. *pine*  I heart Hugh. Between him and James Marsden, I really don't care if  X-Men 2  is total crap (not that I think it will be), but it would still be worth it just to perv on those two. However, it seems like Cyclops is getting majorly shafted this time around so no doubt I'll be drooling most over Wolverine. Oh, and wait, there's more on Rove tonight...the musical act is Audioslave. Sigh....I went to see Audioslave on Friday night @ the Hordern Pavilion. Absolutely fantastic. They may only have 3 songs, but 'Chris Cornell's Amazing Arms' put on a show of their own. The band played well, Chris sang well, and his biceps did a gorgeous mating dance across the stage. My friend Skot had to put up with me yelling for Chris Cornell to take off his shirt, but alas, he never did. :(     I swear I will put up my Byron Bay pics soon...I don't have too many, just some beach/waterfall shots, but hey, better than nothing. It was a lovely lazy weekend with some good food, good company, pretty scenery, and much better weather than rainy old Sydney!   Big thanks to Glenn, for being so sweet and thinking of me while in Adelaide over Easter. He found the Pilates for Dummies DVD I've been searching for and bought it for me as an early birthday present. And a huge belated thank you to Rammstein for the beautiful butterfly brooch from Turkey. I have been photographing some of my favourite butterfly collection items, so there were soon be pics of some b-fly shoes, the lovely brooch, my musical butterfly bath sponge, and no, sorry, no pics of the butterfly g-string, my funniest b-day gift from last year. ;-)
