urlLink    The Visa Verdict is In   Well, I've gotten word from Immi.gration. The news is in. Finally. It's only taken almost 2 years. Unfortunately I have to be a total pain in the ass and not reveal what the verdict is, whether I'm happy or sad, whether I'm packing or unpacking. My laywer just emailed me to tell me what's up. Anyhoo, I'm so sorry to not say anything, but I promised my parents that I would tell them the news (good or bad) first. As soon as I've spoken to them, I will spread the word. I just can't believe they've finally made a decision.
