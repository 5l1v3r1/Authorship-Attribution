Hey, hey, hey! Still me! Still here! It's going on 7.30am now. I actually didn't doze off all night. Still plodding through the website content...oy, oy, oy. Am starting to feel verrrrry sleepy! Must keep going...must resist putting head down on desk.   I did go see Shihad last night, briefly. I left for like an hour and a half to go see them, then came back to work. Shihad were fantastic. Their new album does  really  well live and their oldies but goodies still kick ass. If that skinny little boy can rock that hard, maybe there's a chance for me!  Okay, back to work!
