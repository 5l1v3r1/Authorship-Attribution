Congrats to Kristikeet on getting a job! Woo-hoo! Very exciting! You go, girl! :) I spent the evening with Kristen and her friends/ex-coworkers at The Rose Hotel tonight. Very fun, funny, and lord the pizza and bruschetta was yummy. We're both coughing now - possibly from the smoke from the fires? My head is pounding - off to bed!
