i'm beginning to wonder if my body purposely gets ill the first free moment i have.&nbsp;&nbsp; i guess my body is just trying to be  polite  by not wrecking a work/school week or a vacation with illness, and i'm quite thankful for this   but      ....   since i dropped my little sister off at the airport  (after a two week visit)  a few hours ago&nbsp;my temperature has been rising as well as my general feeling of being sick.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have rapidly evolved from a happy host&nbsp;to a cranky ball of ache.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i had really wanted to clean my apartment after the storm of tea cups and biscuit crumbs, but now all i really can do is whimper at the cat and obsessively take my temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;  (although, i do love a reason to obsessively&nbsp;take my temperature.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   atleast i'm spending some quality nap time with the cat before i leave town for the next adventure.
