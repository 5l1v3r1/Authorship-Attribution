new york city seems to constantly battle my pocketbook.&nbsp;&nbsp;this is mostly because this is&nbsp;a city where it even costs money to breathe.&nbsp;&nbsp; which mostly seems at battle with my experiences in the city i truly love (london, for those of you new to the home game)&nbsp; where although many things are expensive, you can still love socialism for providing fun free things,&nbsp;ah. &nbsp;whereas new york city, the center of the capitalistic world, seems rather hesitant to offering anything for free.   my little sister and i have a knack for ignoring everything except the sale racks in clothing stores.&nbsp;&nbsp; we like to maximize our fun for the least amount of money possible.&nbsp; thus the new york city pricetag seems to cause a little bit of conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp; especially when the things that are free seem to be free for a very specific reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; like for instance the walking tour that didn't move...   back in my london days, i loved walking tours.&nbsp; it was a wonderful way to soak up some of the history from the winding streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; so in trying to replicate the fun of a walking tour with my sister, we tried out a freebie.   somehow i wonder if these speaks volumes about americans in general, but during the first hour of the tour the tour group moved from one side of the street to the other side of the street.&nbsp; that's it.&nbsp;&nbsp; the tour guide did seem knowledgeable, but because we were in a place where there are more people living on this particular street block than in small town usa&nbsp; it was hard to hear a damn thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i was personally holding out for the great revelation in the tour, and something that involving actually moving around, but as it never happened we ditched the tour group.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  i'd like to stress the this tour group only managed to cross the street in the time of an hour.&nbsp; and it wasn't a very wide street to cross.
