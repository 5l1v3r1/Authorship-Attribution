Quick post again.   I went to a RallyCross on Sunday ( urlLink pictures ).&nbsp; It was fairly interesting, but I'm not subjecting my only car to that treatment.&nbsp; Today I got my new Microsoft Prime card (discount card for restaurants, hotels, etc).&nbsp; The old design was fairly metrosexual (polka dots and all) but the new one takes the cake!    urlLink
