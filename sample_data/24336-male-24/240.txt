Hmm, even though it looks down right now, here are some examples from an  urlLink IRC quotes page :  &lt;Chirako&gt; You know what cereal is really nasty? &lt;Chirako&gt; Gravy Train. &lt;Chirako&gt; It's like, these little hard pieces of bran and crumbly beef flavored crap.  You pour water over it, and it gets soggy and makes gravy around it. &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt; Chirako..that's...dog food.. &lt;Chirako&gt; It was NOT dog food! &lt;Chirako&gt; Mommy wouldn't feed me dog food! * Chirako looks at Mommy &lt;Chirako&gt; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! &lt;Chirako&gt; IT'S DOG FOOD! &lt;Chirako&gt; http://www.gravytraindog.com/ &lt;Chirako&gt; AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! &lt;Chirako&gt; She's always been obsessed with me eating dog food... &gt;_&lt; &lt;Chirako&gt; When I was little, she told me the Jerky Treats were real jerky, and I kept eating the whole bag * Chirako gags &lt;Chirako&gt; If there's one thing dogs love, it's rich, &lt;Chirako&gt; beefy gravy. That's why every nugget of &lt;Chirako&gt; Gravy Train is basted in real beef juices. &lt;Chirako&gt; Just mix it with warm water, and you can &lt;Chirako&gt; give your dog a warm homestyle meal, &lt;Chirako&gt; dripping with the delicious gravy he loves. * Chirako graons &lt;Chirako&gt; Oh, man.... I'm gonna kill her &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt; At least Chirako will have: &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt; Healthy skin &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Glossy coat &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Strong teeth and bones &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Builds and maintains body tissue &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Efficient digestion &lt;Disco_Ernie&gt;  Clear eyes &lt;Chirako&gt; ..I should have known. &lt;Chirako&gt; She NEVER makes me breakfast  &lt;stank&gt; guys.. i went out tonight. &lt;stank&gt; i pretended to be a normal college student. &lt;stank&gt; and i stood uncomfortably on a porch with a bunch of people i don't know. &lt;stank&gt; but then i ran into bill and will, who were pretending in the same way. &lt;stank&gt; so we talked about networks and i felt better.  &lt;Dane-lo_brown[DJedi]&gt; I got in trouble in school cause my Espanol teacher asked what architecture we learned from the latinos and i said cardboard boxes &lt;Paradox&gt; So, guys, I have some news. &lt;Paradox&gt; I know I usually don't talk much about stuff unless it's solid, but this is interesting, and I think you should know. &lt;Paradox&gt; I just got an E-mail about an interesting proposition.  * volsung_ perks up. &lt;Paradox&gt; Apparently, there are lesbians that want my 'hard cock.' * volsung_ flips Paradox the bird. &lt;volsung_&gt; :) &lt;Paradox&gt; They want it 'now,' apparently, so the timetable is somewhat limited. &lt;volsung_&gt; Are you going to just take their offer as presented, or is there an opportunity for negotiation? &lt;Paradox&gt; I'm not sure. &lt;volsung_&gt; I'm sure your hard cock is in great demand.  An exclusive deal might not be in your best interest. &lt;Paradox&gt; Last time I got an offer like this, there were some catches.  &lt;andy&gt; moo spelled backwards is moo &lt;andy&gt; no wait  &lt;SDHawk&gt; I tried to go to dictionary.com, but I can't spell it right.  &lt;knobsthebear&gt; How the hell did Korea find time between StarCraft and Diablo II to make it this far into the World Cup?
