Sunday Sillies   Persia came to visit us this weekend all the way from New Yawk Citay.  So today, Evermean and I decided to bring Tayah (whom we were babysitting) over to my house to play with the girls.  We're here.  Persia, Tini, Magenta are taking broken down Charlie's Angels pictures on the web cam, trying to convince ourselves that we are JUST THAT FUCKING FABULOUS..lol.  Meanwhile, Evermean and Tayah are passed out in my bed with a mean waffle hangover.  We bought the movie  urlLink Claudine  and figured that's how we'll spend our Sunday evening.  Claudine.  Tini loves the hell outta that movie.  One word: FUNNY.  Especially when you're not sober..lol.  We probably won't watch it.  I'm sure Persia, Tini and Magenta will end up at somebody's bar tonight or boy-watching at a coffeeshop.  Me?  I'll be forced to lay up in the bed with Tayah and Evermean.  Great.
