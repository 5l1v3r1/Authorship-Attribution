Let This Marinate    What if I just wipe the floor with your love  without even thinking What if the thread you were hanging on had you  strung out on wishful thinking I've become clearer since I came out from under  the wrong impression I've been stuck on the detour baby heading  in the wrong direction    Why didn't I say that?  Can yall tell I have issues today?  LOL
