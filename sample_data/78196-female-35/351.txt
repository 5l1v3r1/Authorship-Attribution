Is That Healthy?   My poor woman.  She's been asleep all day!  Been taking muscle relaxers. Yummy.  I just sat here and watched my sweetie sleep peacefully.  She was in a lot of pain this morning so I can't blame her.  She did take time to grab a bite to eat.  I'm not worried.  The first day is the worst day.  I'd rather her be knocked out then up and can't move.  We'll see what happens.  By they way, thanks for the emails.
