urlLink  WE'RE ALL FEELING THIS PAIN      I'm still feeling "disconnected" from life.  I don't know why but for some reason I feel like I was just left on this planet to suffer with the rest.  Am I going nuts or am I refusing to accept the truth?  The fact that this shit happened?  This time last week what was I doing?  Probably nothing, probably bitching about my life.  But for some reason, when I reflect back to last Monday, I feel like that was another person altogether.  What's the difference between the she last week and the she I be today?  When I get a clue, I'll post.
