Naming Conventions   The way our generations name their kids these days is sickening to me.  I'm so tired of EESHA's and QUAN'S and DILLON'S AND JORDAN'S.  What the fuck happened to ol' school names like, Earl, Michael, and Wilbur?  Where did Pearl and Shirley go?  Or how about Barbara or Tabatha?  Are these names extinct?  Does that mean we'll be forced to conform with these new-aged naming conventions?  Will my kid get teased for being named Samantha instead of Sherita?  Will my son be bullied because his name was Donald instead of Dontay?  C'mon folks!  There's really no culture identification behind this cuz everybody is doing it...URRYBODY.  Kathy Lee has her  Cody  (ick), Pamela has her  Dillon , Erykah has her  Seven , BET has their  Cita  (dont get me started on her ass).  What gives?  Pretty soon our children will be named like some android freaks awf da Volton Williams or Citronia Schwartz.  Please make it stop now.  Let's cut the ghetto/trailer names (w/three or more syllables, ending in a -or- named after a car, beer brand or U.S. state).  Let's go back to the days of Michelle and Nicole....John and Anthony.  We scaring the poor school teachers to death.  They are experts at pronunciation.  Not anymore.
