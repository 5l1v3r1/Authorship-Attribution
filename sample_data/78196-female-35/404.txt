Jerk In a Box - MUST...GO....HOME!    It's ALWAYS us.  I read  urlLink this article  because I couldn't resist.  But I'm telling you, I just busted out laughing like a fool once I got started.  What a dumbass!  If the feds can find drugs shipped in coffee cans, teddy bears, etc.  What made him think they wouldn't FIND his black ass?  He didn't just ship his ass to Dallas!    This was the funniest part:    On Saturday, Billy Ray Thomas, a driver for Pilot Air Freight, picked up the crate at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and delivered it to McKinley's parents' home in suburban DeSoto.  When Thomas went to unload the 350-pound crate from his truck, he saw a pair of eyes and thought there was a body inside.  Then McKinley broke the box open and crawled out, said police Lt. Brian Windham.   LOL!!!  "When I seen my momma's porch, I know'd dere wuz freedom!"  What da fuck?  Dude gots to be retarded.  Sure.  Sweat bullets and sniff jet fuel for hours.  Ingenious!    What was he gonna say when he got home?  "Ize home momma!!!"  "When I see'd you momma, I know'd dur wuzza gawd!"   Black people!  We should all stand in line and smack the holy fuck out of this clown.    Please help me understand why he let his boy convince him to do it.  Whyyyyy did he fill out his OWN shipping tag?  LMAO.  Contents: ME...lol  He needs to ship himself straight to  urlLink St. Elizabeths'  cuz that's where he belongs.  So I can stand at the gate and yell, "KICK HIS ASS SEABASS!"  I can hear the jokes now.  1-800-shippa*****  LOL
