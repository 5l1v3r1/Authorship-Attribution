urlLink   urlLink      THE MEDIA IS FULL OF CRAP!!!     I'm glad I went to the protest last Saturday.  The picture above kind of makes me think.  This country is so focused on ending what they see as "evil" but the simpler things like domestic racism still go on here.  Well, that's another reason why I'm glad I went to this protest.  The brother bearing this sign said it all man. I'm telling you.   I finally got my  urlLink pictures  back from the Anti-War Protest. Even though the media sharks did the usual  urlLink propaganda spreading , here's my take on the events that took place.   Yes some of the events may have required police intervention, but everyone was not a friggin masked Anarchist.  They failed to include the positive stuff so here's what I saw in 4+ hours.  And to think, I was rolling with the media to get good pictures and we have two separate stories.   urlLink The real media folks in DC told the truth.
