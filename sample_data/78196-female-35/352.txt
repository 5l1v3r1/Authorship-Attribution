Sometimes You Have to Let Go      Does anyone share my pain?  Please tell me.  I wanted these boots so bad I could taste it.  We all know the ones (above).  I was awf da straight 'phone a friend' when Beyonce was on TRL about a month ago.  I KNOW SHE AINT GOT STILETTO TIMS ON!!  So of course, after pressing my forehead on the television screen, I had to call the ONE person I knew who could actually tell me who these boots were by.  My cousin, Teneal.  Pretty girl/dimepiece/video chick/up north fashion icon/can afford anything cuz she's so flippin fine.  When I got her on the phone, she was awf da, "Yeh girl...I got those!"  Of course she had to call every Saks in Jersey to land a pair.  Ticket price?  $748.00 plus tax.  Um....Nona?   Let it go hon!!!!  It's too close to Christmas for you to be daydreaming about rocking these Manolos sweetie.  I couldn't even begin to open my mouth and ask Evermean for them.  No way!  These boots are a little too heavy on the pockets.  I've accepted it.  It's over.  No no to Manolo.  Oh and for the record folks, they're sold out nationwide.  That's unless you want to pay a grip on Ebay (I've seen a pair for 5 g's).    If someone comes up with a knockoff pair, I just might have to violate the fashion code.  Eff dat.  Either that or start up my ghetto math: hmmm how many dime bags would I have to sell to land these boots?  -or- how many lap dances would I have to perform?  -or- Is prostitution still illegal?   LOL!!  Nah....I'm so over it.   I had to knock myself in the head and tell those evil thoughts of Manolo boots to GET OUTTA DERE!!
