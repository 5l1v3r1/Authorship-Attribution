Little Marcy - 'Wooden Cha Know It?'    Now some shit makes you mad okay?!!  Who the fuck is  urlLink Little Marcy ?  Why yall?  Why?  I got a right mind to slap the piss out of her creator.  What the hell is wrong with this chick?  Maaan some people!  First there was Willie Tyler and Lester, then LIttle Magic, and now we got Little Marcy.  Just one day...just one day with  urlLink Marcy's  ass!  I'd hang that little wooden trick and sing "You Can't Win" until she begs for Marcy Mercy..LOL  See?  I told yall about religious extremists!  What the hell can Marcy do for me?  Will she bring me closer to Jesus?  I don't think so.  And she got a nerve to have dropped CD's!  You mean to tell me Little Marcy is laying tracks?   urlLink Check out the names of her songs .  I'm thinking Little Marcy needs Dr. Phil, Dr. Suess or something.  Either that or let termites have at her splinter ridden ass!  She's prolly one of Dr. Suess' ex hoes and she's mad that she couldn't get krunked up no mo' so she found da lawd.  Somebody help me understand this one.
