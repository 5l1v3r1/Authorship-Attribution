Today's Dedication      I watched the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show last night after weeks of anticipation and lemme tell you, I GOT LIFE!!! It was phenomenal, but the hightlight of the night was Ms. Tyra baby!  She walked circles around those girls man plus she was the most  urlLink STACKED  woman on stage (sigh).  I just had to dedicate today to her cuz she's legendary and definitely still has the grace and style she had years ago.  I've always thought she was pretty, no doubt, but had no idea she was the diva she is.  I was on the edge of my bed shouting, "WORK BITCH!!!! WALK TYRA!!!"  She looked  urlLink so dayum cute out there  with her little fine self.     My favorite  urlLink Old Navy chick  looked cute too and  urlLink this new short-haired girl , she was definitely too cute for words.
