I said YES   One of my favorite bloggers has invited me to be part of the writing staff for their new  urlLink site .  How can I say no?  Plus, while I was pondering this whole thing with my roomie, I get an email from  urlLink Tracy's woman !  Oh lawd, what did I do to deserve the attention?  I think it'll be fun and the rest of the girls are off the hook (funny).  I'm excited and hopefully I won't get fired...lol.  So check it out, join, read, whatever fancies you.  In the meantime, Imma go see if my new uniform fits my butt.  Yall know it's a little bit misunderstood and I aint wearing tight pants like security guards........no way Jose!...lol
