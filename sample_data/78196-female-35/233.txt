To See Or Not To See   I'm up, recovering, and now so dayumed hungry.  The problem is, I have on my glasses.  HATE THEM!  See, I had some "eye problems" last night and was forced to remove my contacts and wear these two big 1-inch thick glass sun dials on my face.  Glasses suck.  I look like Beverly Beasley in these jonts!  How can I face the world (no pun intended) with these spek-ti-kyools on?  That aint right.  Since I can't put my contacts back in right now (cuz I slept wiff da Budweiser frog), and I despise these fucking focals, should I just go straight wiff no chaser?  Translation: Should I go out without any corrective lenses?  How far would I make it?  I bet it'd be like Survivor, and I gotta sniff out my food.  Oh God.  Either that or wear these rims on my cheeks.  I need a better pair.  I need to ice out my rims or kit them out somehow cuz these old ones make me look like an extra on  Wierd Science .  No bullshit.   I'll be back to share my adventure, cuz fuck it....I'm going out with my glasses on.  I'm brave.
