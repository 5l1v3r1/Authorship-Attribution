Stressed   Had a job interview yesterday for NASA.  It went really well and I felt way good afterwards, but I've got the post-interview jitters.  So I basically slept all day today trying not to think about this shit.  How cool would it be if I could design for NASA?  I'm not even gonna start that wishful thinking shit.  I'm just gon chill and see what happens.     Because I don't handle stress well (sober), I've been a real "card" towards Evermean.  No fault of hers, I'm just an asshole sometimes.  And V-Day is tomorrow (hmph..perfect timing, Nona), which I happen to HATE!!  I like buying gifts and doing sweet things all year round.  Fuck this pressure!  AGGHHHH!!  If I see anymore pink, red and white, imma throw up!  Valentine's Day is the debbil!  I love Evermean to pieces though.  Valentine's Day is just a way to remind you of past relationships.  Everytime you have a wonderful Valentine's Day that is spent with "the one you love", afterwards (when you've broken up), this fucking stupid assed holiday bites you in the ass.  Cuz you're forced to think about the rat bastards you had so much fun with before.  With Evermean, I choose NOT to do that to myself.  Of course, if we ever break up my whole dayumed life will be a sick reminder of how good I had it.  I guess that means I won't be messing up anytime soon huh?  NOT A CHANCE!!  LOL      Here's a fun fact: I haven't drank in more almost two weeks!  THAT'S A RECORD!!! LOL.  Not that I'm trying not to drink, I've just been too busy to hang out.  Plus I haven't hung out wiff Kreg and Nem cuz I gots to keep my shit awf da 100% clean..LOL.  Lawd, no wonder I'm stressed out.
