WhatDaProllemIyah?   Evermean is sick - really sick with flu-like symptoms. My help didn't help.  Need a doctor...STAT.  Took my braids out - Can't deal wiffem no mo and wont get 'em redone until end of next week.  Basically awf da headwraps and bad cornrows.    Spoke to the ex-gf - Long talk.  Feel bad for being mean b4.  We understand each other now, but I'm still the heartbreaking/evil bitch.  My offline friends are divorcing me - Been way undercover and not calling them at all.  Blogworld has been my life cuz real world bites.

Beefing with my sister  - I refuse to play makeup (this time)  Got the housewife blues - Evermean's the breadwinner and I'm not comfortable (glad I have her doe)  Became a TV-watchin', junkfood snackin', cat-nap takin' whore - If I watch ONE MORE "Who's My Baby's Daddy" or "Behind The Music" I'm gonna puke.  Spoke to my personal trainer (listened to him bitch about my whereabouts) - There goes my self-esteem.   On a lighter note:  Rent for March is paid  Going to  urlLink Savannah  in three weeks - AND I'M GON' PARTY!!!
