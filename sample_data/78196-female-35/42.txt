I'm going to the  urlLink Birchmere to see Etta James  tonight.  It's been about 3 years since I've seen this lady throw down.  She is a trip!  Her lyrics carried me through the second half of the 90's and thanks to her, I didn't kill anyone..lol.  I have no idea what I'm going to wear.  I think I'll give "ghetto fabulous" just for shits and giggles.  Remind myself that although I'm thirtysomething, I'm still time enough for these younginz.  Yeh!  I can wear my ass hanging out too dammit!  I gots breast-iss-es too I can put on display.  Nah, not going  urlLink too hard , just want to wear something nice with a sexy/ghetto edge..lol.  How does that sound?  What does ghetto fabulous mean anyway?  That I can dress like I got sense and a good assed job, but I'll windmill you in the parking lot if you get me wrong?  Who knows.  I just know Imma try to survive out there with 4 inch pumps.
