I finally went to see my chiropractor today.  No longer do I have the knots in my back!  Oh joy!  They put me on this bed that heats up and has this sort of bowling ball mechanism inside it.  OH THAT FEELS GOOD!   Then I got the freaky Reiki chick to settle for reflexology.  As soon as I came in the door, she hit me with the, "are your ready for Reiki dawwwwwling?"  UGH!  I'm like ..okay, let's see..SHE DOES REFLEXOLOGY TOO.  So yes, I was her bitch for 30 minutes. Foot bitch to be exact.  It was a learning experience.  I'm not really into pressure points and stuff but I swear it felt so good whatever she did to my feet.  It felt strange because my whole body went limp, relaxed, and just really enjoyed her touching me.  I felt safe..yeh that's it..safe.  I got so caught up, I almost called her "mama".  All the while, Ms. Freaky Reiki was telling me how much she enjoyed feet.  FEET?  You  mean to tell me she is actually "enjoying" touching my feet?  I think I got pimped by a self-proclaimed foot freak.  I need a minute.   On my way home I bought a  urlLink book .  All I can say is CLAUDE HAMERCY!  She definitely experienced her share of calamitous moments.  Sheesh!
