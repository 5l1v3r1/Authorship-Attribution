Day of Silence - In Remembrance              Our real self, the soul, is immortal.  We may sleep for a little while in that change called death, but we can never be destroyed.  We exist, and that existence is eternal.   This body has come, and it will vanish; but the soul essence within it will never cease to exist.  Nothing can terminate that eternal consciousness.     -Paramahansa Yogananda-
