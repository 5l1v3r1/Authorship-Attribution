Today's Dedication     Nikka Costa. Today is hers.  I obviously slept on her talent.  That chick can SING!!!  Her song, Just Because is so bomb.  Makes me think of Evermean.  Besides, she thinks I'm mad at her today.  So not!  Anyway, Nikka...girl....yooz da bess.  Who were you thinking of when you wrote:    I take you in and I hold my breath Try to save the time that's passing by And if you came to say goodbye A thousand summers would never dry Every tear that touched my face  And they don't laugh the way you do And they don't smile the way you do And their eyes don't shine the way yours do  Without the words to fall back on I'm afraid it's hopeless to describe And if I tried, I'd probably steer you wrong Cause a thousand phrases would never say How I feel today  And they don't laugh the way you do And they don't smile the way you do And their eyes don't shine the way yours do  I love I love I love you just because
