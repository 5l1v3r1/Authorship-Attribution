Things I got from my mama:  Roo pouch hips and ass pretty smile bad feet a heart (giving a fuck) grey hair birthmark (in the front of my head) emotional terrorism calamity threshold ability to whup ass smart mouth  Things I DID NOT get from my mama, I got these from my  daddy:   ability to drink a lot ability to "smoke out" the ability to be the last one standing at a party pimpin' game w/women game w/men ability to kill somebody's ass my bitch assed attitude on-stage talent comedic talent ear for music open mindedness survival skills the insane gene fear and knowledge of God (higher power)**       Disclaimer: although back in the day, my dad was "freakin", he later became a Deacon and has since become a soldier for the Lord.
