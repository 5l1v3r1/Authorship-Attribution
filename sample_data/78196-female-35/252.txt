A Straight Girl's Nightmare   I had a chat with one of my queen/gay malefriends last night.  He gave me the update on all the drama in his life, including some other things we needed to catch up on.  Lotsa fun!  Miss dat fool.  Anyway, he took me on an online tour of some of the  urlLink DC undercover brothers  (select DC, MD, or VA)out here and then I saw  urlLink THIS .  Man...WHY????????????????????  ONE WORD: DARRIAN (sigh) Ruffneck prison trade?  Aw lawd!  So Shante's baby's daddy who got locked up (on a humble) while he was chillin' on his motorcycle last Summer is now PRISON TRADE?  What da?  Is this where lots of the fine black men have gone?  TO PRISON TRADE?  Noooooooooooooooo!     Don't get me wrong, to each his own.  Truth be told, I used to be a straight girl (b4 somebody took me to the gate..lol).  So I know a fine man when I see one.  I can always appreciate a sexy assed black, "skrong", beautiful black you-betta-fuck-me-right-now MAN.  So of course, while on the phone with my friend I was awf da, "DAYUM!!!!" looking at some of these pictures.  Too bad I wasn't able to find BLACK FEMALE PRISON TRADE.  That would've been a blast...LOL.
