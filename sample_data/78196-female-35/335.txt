Sunshine N The Hood   Tini and I done broke Sunshine (our new roommate) in.  She's a bonafied party animal thanks to the House of Martini...LOL.  Saturday night, I had two of my pals come to visit.  Sunshine and the three of us got sooooooo crunk!  We drank about 4 six packs of Skyy and Bacardi Silver and then did straight shots of Vodka while playing Jenga..LOL.  That was a blast.  It was so funny cuz DC stops selling alcohol at 10:00 pm, so we decided to drive out to Tic Toc Liquors which is located in the Latino hood!  Poor Sunshine was shaking in her boots going, "Is this the ghetto?"  After we died laughing, we finally told her that not really.   I guess to her it was but not a true ghetto..no way.  So we came back here and got tore up!   Larer on, my pals stumbled home...Sunshine went out with her English boyfriend (who's a drinking maniac)...and I passed out faced down in my bed  until Evermean came over and &#%@#*@ me...LMAO.  Then yesterday, we did it all over again.  Tini made Evermean and I these mystery drinks she called,  Little Dirty Muskrats  and we cruised all afternoon buzzed.   Later on last night, Evermean and I filmed our very first porno comedy (via web cam)..LOL.  Yeh, while Tini looked on in horror and dayum near laughed herself to death.   Okay ya freaks..we weren't naked..LOL
