Friday Five   I think I'll keep this borrowed idea.   urlLink The Friday Five .  Thanks again for the referral,  urlLink TrivialScript .     1. Have you ever had braces?  Any other teeth trauma?  No braces, just a root canal.    2. Ever broken any bones?  No.    3. Ever had stitches?  Yes, on my ear after I got my head bashed in the doorway, fucking around playing as a kid.    4. What are the stories behind some of your [physical] scars?  I have a permanet scar on my lip from my insane cat.  I got a scar on the back of my neck from when one of the little hoodrat boys hit me with a brick.  And most recently, I have three Freddy Kreuger style scratches on my ass from when Evermean tried to pull me from under the bed (cuz I fell out drunk) and the frame scratched the hell outta me.       5. How do you plan to spend your weekend?  Krunk.
