urlLink The Friday Five     1. What makes you homesick?  Nothing.  Only if I got locked up in a third world country.  Then I'd be homesick   2. Where is "home" for you? Is it where you are living now, or somewhere else (ie: Mom & Dad's house, particular state/city)?  Home is in the "Fruit Loop".  That is Dupont Circle, DC's gay area.   3. What makes it home for you? People? Things?  If I can go in the fridge, sleep and hump whomever I please, that's home..lol   4. Where is the furthest you've been from home, miles-wise?  Jamaica.  Was going to Queensland, Australia this year, but Osama effed dat up (I ain't flyin out da country)   5. What are your plans for this weekend?  Be the wifey with Evermean.
