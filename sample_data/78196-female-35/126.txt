Temporary Madness   This blog will be at a standstill indefinitely.  Calamity has  infected  my loved-ones and I "oun" 'ppreciate dat!  I must flee so I may be of aid to the ones who matter to my life.  Unfortunately, I will not have time to record my daily rants.  But never fear my little freaks, E.C. will be back in full swing soon.
