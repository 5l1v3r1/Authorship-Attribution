Cough It Up Kitty   I think my cat has a breathing problem.  He needs his adenoids taken out.  I'm sitting here at this 'puter and I start to here somebody snoring...LIKE A GROWN MAN.  Before I freak out awf da thinking somebody done ran up in heeya, I turn and look behind me.  Why is Shayde's fat ass laid over on one side, snoring like Nipsey Russell?  Either he needs to go on a diet or check his chest macavity (lol).  Imma see if I can grab a shot of this wombat right now.  I'll keep you posted.
