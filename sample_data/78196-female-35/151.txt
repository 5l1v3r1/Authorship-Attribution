Send Luv To Da Chirren   I'm bored today (like you couldn't guess) and started reading up on some of my favorite blogs.   urlLink Alissa Nichole  of  urlLink Bling Bling  is one of my daily reads and I have to send out some luv to her.  She said,  "i'm just extremely special. i have this way of magnifying stress. to epic proportions." OMG!  I feel her on that one.  Me too, pumpkin.  (lighting my candle, swaying like Michael Jackson)  "YOO ARE NOT ALONE...I AM HERE WIFF YOOOOOOO"   Girl, if I could hug you (and not get cut by Evermean) I would.  I like her blog cuz she's real.  She never bites her tongue and her posts are always very interesting.  And I'm so proud that little brown girl is in school (feelin warm inside).  If yall get a chance, knock on her door.  She's nice...  :-)
