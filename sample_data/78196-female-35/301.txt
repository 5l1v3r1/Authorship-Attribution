Post Savannah   I'm finally back from Savannah.  I can't even describe some of the shit that went down.  I do have notes and stuff to write on my blog but it's soooo long.  What I'll do is break them up into days.  So my Savannah stories will probably cover about 3-4 days depending on how long each one is.  I got the emails!  Thanks guys.
