Freedom Is Mine Today     I close my eyes and I think of all the things that I want to see 'Cause I know, now that I've opened up my heart I know that Anything I want can be, so let it be...  - India Arie   I decided to let go of the bitterness I had towards my ex-bf.  Yesterday was bad b/c he and I have been chatting so I was kinda blown by some of the exchanges/views shared.  From this point on, I refuse to carry that baggage.  A sista gots to let it be. I feel like one of the sweatshop workers on The Wiz after Eviline was killed and they peeled off their costumes, awf da  Can you feel a brand new day?  ...lol  Even though it's been 3 years, I've finally opened myself up enough to let another person inside my heart.  At this point, I believe that Mrs. Evermean Martini would've stolen it whether I was with him or not.  It scares me sometimes when I think of how happy I am with her.   Iluhdatguuh!!!
