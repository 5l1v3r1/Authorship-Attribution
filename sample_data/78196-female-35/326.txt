Happy Days Are Here Again   After 6 months of complete misery, I finally landed a job!  As of yesterday, I'm employed.  WOOOO HOOO!  I'll be working as a web developer for an IT company as part of the web team at a govt. agency.    Thank God for that.  Definitely.  Being unemployed/borderline broke aint fun.  Had it not been for Tini and Evermean, I'dda been a serious head case.  They were my financers, my shoulders to cry on, and my cheering section.  Thanks yall.  I owe you my life.  (exhaling begins)
