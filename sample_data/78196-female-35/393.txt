WE MISS  YOU TARRON!        I heard from my cousin Tarron a few days ago (that's him on the right).  He's  urlLink here .  Dayum.  Thanks to ol' Gee Dubya, he's stationed there until things settle down.    Just when he was in full party mode, they scooped his ass.    Dass okay Tarron, we are partying enough for you baby!!!  You know how we go.  We wish that you'd be home for our trip to Savannah next year.    Tini and Evermean send their love!  Hugs and kisses Tarron!
