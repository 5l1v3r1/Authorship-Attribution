I Can't Get It Out Of My Head   I'm listening to Internet radio and came across a parody song.  It's called  I Wanna Bomb Osama  (done to the tune of  LaBamba ).  So now I can't stop singing, "I Wanna Bomb Osama! (la la la la la la Bamba)"  What am I, sick?  Yes I am!  I'm sick of all this Afghanistan bombing shit.   I'm sick to the  nines (99.9999999%). lol!!!  But I could spend all day reading  urlLink this ...LOL.  Don't ask why.
