I cannot believe this!  I have heard stories from friends, co-workers, and family members about their experiences with this horrible tragedy.  My mind can't even process all that has occured.  I find myself obcessed with the news and have spent the past 48 hours in front of the TV for fear that I'd miss something.     Upon watching the news coverage, I saw all of the lines at the Red Cross for blood donations.  To my demise, I realized that there were NO BLACK PEOPLE in line.  I could not believe that our people would be so scared, so uneducated, so selfish during a time like this.  I saw NY blood donor locations and DC locations and the only Blacks I saw were working there.  This is sickening to me.  So yes, I've decided (since I've donated before) to take my ass down to the Red Cross and give one hour of my time and one pint of my blood.  Although God has really blessed my family, me, and all friends around me, I still feel helpless in that I need to do SOMETHING.  So I'm volunteering myself AND MY ROOMMATE to go give blood.   For all African-Americans who read my blog, please  urlLink read this  and then you'll see why I'm so pissed off.  It doesn't take rocket science to know that African-Americans perished in these disasters.
