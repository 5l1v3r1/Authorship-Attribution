Thumbs Down - Way Down   DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT go see   Vanilla Sky  !  That movie sucked ass chunks mkay?  First of all, the trailer was extra deceiving!  I'm thinking it's a good  Fatal Attraction  type movie. NOPE.  It's more like  The Matrix  gone bad.  Not to mention it's two and a half hours long, and two of those hours you'll spend asking yourself, "What the hell is going on? Am i on crack?"  If you still go see it, don't say you haven't been warned.  That movie is bad.
