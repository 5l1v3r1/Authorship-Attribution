Ticked Off   Some people wanna make you choke the life out of them man!  My ex moved to Florida about 2 months ago.  Yep!  Packed up and bounced.  Our then relationship was rocky, but fact of the matter is I was abandoned (basically).  Now my "ex" is back on a surprise visit and expects me to be happy about the shit. I don't appreciate being left for one thing, but then how can I just pick up where we left off when it was made clear to me that my "ex" was moving for good.  So I did what any hot-blooded savage my age would and MOVED ON.  Now I am involved with someone who I cared about for a while now and finally we are able to hook up.  She's not only one of my best friends, but also my lover right now and things have been pretty consistent in terms of us seeing each other.  Now what am I supposed to do?  Just stop what I'm doing, swallow what I'm chewing just to humor my "ex"?  I don't think so.  I'm simply going to have an in person chat with the "ex" and make it very clear: YOU MOVE, YOU LOSE.
