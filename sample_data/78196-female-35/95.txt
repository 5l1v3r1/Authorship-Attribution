AIDS - Aint It a Dayumed Shame?!   Last night I had one my friends over and he gave me a bit of bad news.  Two guys who I really like and care about have contracted the ICK, AIDS.  It broke my heart to know that two of the sweetest guys I know and also my two favorite make-up artists have contracted this horrible disease.  I'm blown away!  I wish I could do something to take it away from them.  It is so sad to even think about it.  They are both attractive, young, talented men (one is a female impersonator and one is a professional makeup artist).  This really makes me sick.
