Desperate Measures    Reason #1 for not ever wanting to date men again:   I received this email from a guy on BlackPlanet.  "Boo check me out and tell me what u think."   urlLink This  is what he sent me.  (please be advised, it's a nude shot).  Can somebody please explain to me why folks do this type of shit?  Str8 women all over the world, listen up!!!!   Stop some men (keyword:some) from pulling desperate stunts like this.  If you don't act now, many of you will be FORCED to become "havable".  What does that mean?  Us chicklickas can gitcha.  LOL!   Special thanks to Vida Verde for that "havable" reference.
