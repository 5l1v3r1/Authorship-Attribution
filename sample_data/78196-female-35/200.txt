Today's Dedication   I'm dedicating today to Al and Keisha.  Better known as: alopecia.  If I don't get my hair redone, I'mma lose my status.  They gon' come get me soon.  My braids are holding on for dear life and I'm too lazy to go get it redone.  Headwraps and scarves don't even do justice anymore.  My shit is WRECKED.  That's what I get for not going to see my hurdressa.  Al and Keisha done set my ass up.  The front of my head (the temporal area) looks like there's no hair there.  Am I dreaming or is it juss curls?  They always tell you that when you get your hair braided/twisted, whatever, to try and refrain from pulling it back because your edges will break.  CONSIDER MINE BROKEN.   I'm seriously pushing the Stevie Wonder look right now.  Extra forehead awf da where my hayah go?  Thanks Al and Keisha.  For fuckin my ruts up.  I gotta call Sparkle (my hurdressa)...lol.  This is bad.   Disclaimer: Al And Keisha are NOT affiliated with Keisha and Patty (quiche and pat&egrave;)  or Mary and Juana (figure it out). They're not even friends.  LOL
