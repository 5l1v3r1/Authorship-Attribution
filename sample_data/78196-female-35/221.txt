Today's Dedication   I refuse to feel bad today.  REFUSE!!!  When I call my parents' house and my dad answers the phone, after I ask "How are you?", he always says this: "I'm blessed by the best, I refuse to stress, cuz my life could be less".  I used to laugh at him and make fun after he says that, but I gotta thinkin'...THAT SHIT MAKES SENSE!   So today is dedicated to my father because I'm going to go by that statement today, hold my head up and keep on pushin'.  Still no job (got a few callbacks - too far away), but I am blessed by the best.  I gotta roof over my head, food in my fridge (thanks Tini), clothes and tons of shoes in my closet, a pack of cigarettes, DSL, and a TV.  I'M AIGHT, YUNG!!  Luhyoo daddy!!  B.K.A.  Big Lah ....LOL
