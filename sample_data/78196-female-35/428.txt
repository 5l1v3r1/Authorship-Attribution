The Fall Off    I fell off.  End of story.  Shit was testy. Major changes.  No motivation.  No drive.  No regard for anything but the immediate.  Into instant gratification right now.  Screw longterm outlook on anything.    Other than that, I'm chillin'.  Wore a wig for yall as you can see on the left.  That's my final failed attempt at going porn star.  Forget it.  On to new business.  On a good note - Brother and wifey had a new baby last week.  Little Naila.     Holla to my blog family!   urlLink Lique ,  urlLink Lil Brown Girl ,  urlLink B-Girl,   urlLink Trent , and  urlLink onye .  If I missed anyone (hugs).  Lique!  Holla atcha girl....  Fantasia!
