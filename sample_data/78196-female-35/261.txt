HFVD       Top Five Things I've Thought About Doing For Valentine's Day:     1.  Pawn my 2 ct. bracelet that my ex-boyfriend bought me.   2.  Pawn my diamond ring my ex-girlfriend bought me.   3.  Shoot spitballs at all the ghetto brawds wiff 15 balloons on the train.   4.  Become a teddy bear terrorist (kill them all). 5.   Bitchslap all the fools who say,  Valentimes     Above all, I'm thankful for having a Valentine.  Hell, somebody loves my big ass.  I say HFVD (Happy Fucking Valentine's Day) to all the bloggies out there.  Have fun, be safe, and let's cancel this evil day next year!
