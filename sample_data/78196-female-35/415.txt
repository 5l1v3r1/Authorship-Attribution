Almost *Dead*    I dropped my laptop this morning!   It fell 3 feet off my desk.   Half hour went by.  Still didn't come on.  Oh the horror!!!!!    Finally, it came back on.  Thank goodness.  I would've been SOL because my laptop is my bread and butter.  I use it at work so the gubment minions can't sniff my shit..lol I was reading PC World at the doc's office yesterday and they had this advertisement about software that enables companies to record keystrokes, take video snapshots of every singe web page employees view, simultaneously view emails and attachments, etc.  Man eff dat.  Use company PC, get NABBED for doing just about anything.  Fortunately, I work for a company that allows me to bring my own PC on site.  And I have my own connection, I don't log in to the network unless I have to upload or test something.  And I done dropped my shit.    Glad it's over.  Cuz a sista woulda backed up traffic on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.  LOL
