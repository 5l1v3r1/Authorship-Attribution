Final Answer   Love Junky?  Emotional Terrorist?  Protestor?  I don't fucking know!  What I do know is this is BAD.  REALLY REALLY BAD.  I would like to say that yes..I am currently in a relationship with a person who is a dear friend and has a sparkling personality.  My job right now (since I've analyzed my love shit) is to make sure that neither one of us is victimized.  I have a huge responsibility still because she is my peace.  So I guess I got what I asked for.  Either way, I'm content with it.  And love is definitely part of this equation.  And THAT PART makes me happy.  Not to mention the fact that she "can git it" (wink wink).    DISCLAIMER: The comedic content that is typically found in this blog will return shortly.  Although calamity isn't at all funny, as you know, I find humor everywhere.  This is one of the times I just can't.  But never fear blog freaks!  Just like Jimi Hendrix said, "Look out dere, I'm coming ta gitcha!"
