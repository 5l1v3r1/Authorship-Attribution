Hit'N Run - Ode to the Porclain Goddess   I'm so sorry oh yes I am I really had to use the can Public restrooms aren't really my bag But I'm at work I had to go bad.  My belly rumbled, my back was tight Doing numba 2 at work just aint right I'm sitting here thinking this is crazy! My momma tol' me to be a lady.  All by myself, couldn't ask for more Until somebody came thru the door I didn't wanna jump the gun But embarrassment will make you hit and run  Fanfare: But I washed my haaaaaaanddssss....  Thank you
