Madonna=P.I.M.P.    Lemme jump on the bandwagon and speak on the latest awards show on MTV.  Um Madonna?  Britney?  Christina?  Lesbian action in front of the world.  HELL YEH!  Sweeeeet.   It was good to see Brit and Chris on stage together.  Those media pigs love to make up believe they hate each other.  That's good shit that they performed together and who better with than the Queen of Freak Nasty....Madonna.    I thought that was a chest buster until I saw Beyonce come out the ceiling.  I stopped what I was doing and swallowed what I was chewing to pay full attention to her!  HOLY SHIT!!!  I''m speechless.  Other honorable mentions:  Ms. Vivica -  claude hamercy her chestesses... Pamela - always yummy Snoop - I just wanna hang out with him for one day.  JUST ONE DAY.  Please Snoop!  Please!  Dat fool look like he is fun as hell to party with.   Any nukka with a perm, Now-N-Later gators, a rack of hot girls, and takes his drunk bastard uncle everywhere HAS to be the shit.  "Move to the left nephew"...lol.  That was funny!
