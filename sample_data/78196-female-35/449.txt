Is This The End?         I was flipping channels when, all of a sudden, Evermean starts screaming from the other room, "Nona, turn it on TV ONE!!!!" So I do. I'm stunned. Right before my eyes was none other than NEW EDITION!!! OMG. N.E. Heartbreak. Holy moly...they're doing the steps!!!       So I'm thinking to myself if they sing  Candy Girl   imma lose it. I'm gon git up right chur and Hammertime my ass off. I could not believe New Edition was goin' ol' school on our asses. It took me back.....      Back to the happy times. Erry dayum body was happy. We were some Runnin' Man and Roger Rabbit doing assholes. Loved it!!! Always awf da, "Wuss da new dance?" It was the BEST. Watching Bobby Brown run around the basketball court singing to  Mista Telephone Man  and BBD with those back up dancing girls that made Oaktown 3-5-7 look like some shit. Oh and lets not forget B Angie B. I WANTED TO BE HER. Yall don't understand me!! I WANTEDTO WAKE UP ONE DAY AND MORPH INTO B ANGIE B!!!! Click my heels three times and be dark and lovely...with the almighty weave of truth!     They better be glad Kareoke hadn't been invented. Cuz my ass woulda sang  I Don't Wanna Lose Yo' Luv  in every single venue possible. Bingo halls, bars, cruise ships, and even kids birthday parties. I woulda PERFORMED okay?!!! I wouldn't give a dayum. I woulda gotten my tightest spandex miniskirt and wiggled my beaver in front of all da peoples. They would've all known baby!! WHO DON'T WANNA LOSE YO' LUV??!!! I SED UH....WHOOOO DON'T WANNA LOSE YO LUV?!!! There was something about the way she screamed that spoke to my soul. Instantly, I would dance thrashingly like I worked at the C n C Music Factory.       I wanted to wind it and work my turquoise blazer and black stretch pants just like I went to C C Pennison's School of Backup Dancers. Mayun!! Those were the days. I remember when styling gel became my best friend. And how we fried the shit out of our hair AFTER we soaked it with spritz. I really thought I was cute then. Fried hard curls, spandex and dreams of becoming the next Luke girl. (retrospective sigh)      But yeh, I was watching New Edition catching feelings when all of a sudden I hear... Iz ThisThee Ennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd. Are you my frih-ennnnnnnnnnnnnd?  I used to LOVE that song. Not to mention the fact that it would make think about how my first boyfriend humped my best friend. So I would just listen and cry. I would dig every fingernail I had in my pillow and lament like a gotdayumed fool. THAT WAS THE END. He slept wiff my friend. The song also made me think about my Summer in Jersey when I fell in love with a boy who was WAAAAAAAAAAAY too sexually advanced. He'd always wanna do strange things to me and they almost always involved me taking off my panties. I wouldn't lose my draws but we'd dry hump to glory. And every time he came over my aunt's house, that fucking song would come on. So I'd hump, suffer in silence, hump some more, and dream of being sandwiched by him and Ralph Tresvant. He was my absolute favorite. I just KNEW he would sweep me away, carry me across the threshold, and make sweet sweet love to me. Oh Ralphy (what I would call him in my dreams) Make sweet luh to me Ralphy. I wanna be yo' Candy Girl Ralphy. I CAN stand the rain and you'll see me smile again and forever more.      Snapping out of it and paying attention to the TV, I gotta load of the man himself.           Ralph.       WHAT DA HELL WAS WRONG WIFF ME?     TAKE A GANDER AT RALPH'S FOREHEAD.    Is THIS the man I used to love?!  What happened Ralphy!!!  Oh God nooooooooooo.   Say it aint sooooooo. Ralphy, your hair line.   Did it leave the temples on a quest for the back of your head?   This is the end Ralphy. I'm sorry. It is. Ralphy you suck.        Mama tol' me one day it was gonna happen, but she never told me when. (Oh Ralphy) She told me it would happen when I was much older wish it woulda happened then...      Dammit all to Hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
