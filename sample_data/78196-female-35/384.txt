I'm Stunned     I was telling my good friend  urlLink Soulo  about my Asian girl experience and he told me that last year's dancehall queen was Japanese.  Junko is her name.  Then I saw  urlLink this  (click on "Dancehall Queen Junko").   That messed me up for the rest of the day.  LMAO.  I'm speechless.  The other clips are funny too!   THANKS SOULO!  GOOD LOOKIN' OUT CUZ!
