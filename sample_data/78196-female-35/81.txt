Save the Chirren   I have to share this one.  I was on the subway this morning and there was a chick with her daughter who was about 4 or 5 years old.  A really cute little girl.  So they're sitting behind me and I hear the little girl mumble something and then the mother goes, "Touch my pockybook and imma steal you!"  Yall, this chick was swol' mkay? Who is she gonna steal?  I couldn't believe she actually said that to the little girl.  So I just HAD to check her out again because this was senseless.  When they exited the train, I saw her really good this time.  Ol' girl looked like she should've been rockin a helmet with two horns stickin' out the sides.  Plus she had on some open-toed sandals with some sky blue Betty Boop ankle socks.  Why?  How is her big ass gonna steal a child?  I should've stole HER for dem socks mkay?  I shoulda stole HER for that little ass backpack and that dry assed mane aight?  Does that make sense talking to a child like that?  I think not.
