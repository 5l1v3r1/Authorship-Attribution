Chiffon Rage   I've been chosen as a bridesmaid for a wedding this August.  Can you say PUKE?!!!  Bridesmaids are losers I don't care how you choose to look at it.  The dress, the color, the fabric, the mayhem.  Please God!  Here's the  urlLink blasted dress .  And it's all chiffon!!!!!!!    Tell me.  What the fuck am I going to do with this afterwards?  Ya think Evermean and I can have a night on the town?  Maybe my big ass can lean over the front of a ship and let the chiffon blow in dee wind!!!  Or perhaps I should audition for a lounge act.  Lean across someone's piano and roll around singing, "Fool That I Am" with a cigarette holder betwix my fingers.   What were they thinking?  Why not something chic or en vogue.  No, we had to go Tayressha Does the Elk Lodge.  I hate the dress.  I'll hate the whole process.  I'll forever be bitter over wearing eggplant, a-line, chiffon with coffin ruffles.
