Anita New Look   I need a new do.  I think I'm getting sick of these twisty braids.  My hair has grown considerably now so maybe I'll go back to perms.  AGGHH!!  Perms!  It's been like 6 years since I've had a perm or even had to put curling irons and blow dryers to my hair.  I want to have a cute style for the Summer.  Plus, too many broads have twists now.  Sparkle did something different for me this time (kinda like dreds), and now all these "two strand twist chicks" are asking me what mine is called.  I don't mean to be mean, but I changed my style to be different.  So that means, I DON'T WANT HALF OF BLACK DC ROCKIN THESE AIGHT? Jesus!  DC is the style/fashion clone city of the world.  All it takes is ONE person to wear something new and in a few months..errybody got it.  Sucks!  New York is better.  Everyone has their own style.     I'm thinking of going gothic this Summer.  I like blood red hair color.  NO! NOT GHETTO MAROON OR PINK!  I want like a vampire blood red hair color with a cute behind-the-ear shag.  I think that'll weird my parents out.  My friends already think I'm "special".  Manic Panic has  cool colors.  I like  urlLink Infra Red and Vampire Red .  That'll probably look evil under the sun.  Works for me..lol.  We shall see in a few months, I guess.
