Awf Da Sauce        Last night was a travesty.  My neighborhood had its  urlLink annual event .  Evermean, my baby sis and I decided to go see the sights.  It was so nasty outside.  The race is located like 3 blocks from my house but dayum!  The rain made it awfully messy.  The plan was to meet Tini and stand on the block and just watch the  urlLink drag   urlLink queens   urlLink the   urlLink 17th   urlLink street   urlLink strip .  (view the slideshow  urlLink here )  Since it was so cold and we had to stand out in the street, Evermean came up with what she thought was a great idea - let's buy some cheap wine to keep us warm.  Wonderful.  Evermean, my sister and I each killed a pint of, you guessed it, Mad Dog 20/20.  Strawberry Kiwi to be exact.     I remember back in college that was on our  cheap shit that will get you tore up instantly  list.  It was in the lineup with Cold Duck, Cisco, OE 800, St. Ides, and Red Bull Malt Liquor.  Got two dollas?  You can blow ya wig back fo' cheap!  Obviously I hadn't remembered just how BAD that stuff is.  Flashback.  St. Ides made me fall to my knees and pray for my life.  Cisco (circa 1989) made me flip out and barracade myself in a bedroom cuz I thought my cousin was trying to murder me.  Red Bull made me and my then boyfriend have swinger chat with a random on Amtrak.  How could I forget that?  How could I just act like there was nothing wrong with Evermean's idea?   Stupid.  That's what it's called.  We ended up at the nastiest liquor store in DC cuz I was having a weak bladder moment.  I HAD TO GO!!  We figured that since we were buying something, the clerk would let me use the bathroom.  He did.  I will regret that for the rest of my life.  I walked in the back of the store and entered the door on my left.  It was a rat shithole!  The walls were sweating with some brown substance, the floor tiles were puckering up, someone had thrown up in the toilet (that wouldnt flush), and it stunk to all be dayumed!  If I didn't have to numma 1 so bad, I would have ran out of that place screaming, 'Spawn of satan!'  lol  But a sista had to GO.  I won't give you the gory details any further, but I will say that I need to learn how to stand up, faced forward and pee.  That's definitely a skill I must acquire pronto.    Evermean and my sister (I'll call her Layla Martini) bought three bottles of MD 20/20 and three bottles of cheap soda.  We went outside and poured all the soda out and replaced it with the MD.  Too many cops, you know how it is.  My first sip was so nostalgic, I had to stop in my tracks.  Ahhhh...the fruity taste of poison.  MMMMMM  We had about 4 blocks to walk, so we tried to finish em fast.  I swear.  I can drink.  Hell yeh, Nona can thow 'em back.  But yung!  It should be illegal to get drunk that dayumed fast!  Like 10 minutes flat all three of us were blithering idiots.  BRING ON THE DRAG QUEENS!  By the time we reached 17th street, the race was over.  But the street party was just beginning.  Tini and Magenta had gone back in.  So what.  We stayed out in the street and  watched the "girls" parade all around in wet wigs.  That was short lived cuz one, we were plastered, and two, the cops kept yellin on the horn, "IF YOU'RE NOT WEARING HEELS, GET OUT DA STREET!"  Of course that sent us into a laughing fit.  Finally the cops reopened the street to traffic so all the fun continued at the bars on the strip.  Layla, Evermean and I went to one a few blocks away.  We called Tini threatening her if she didn't join us and it was oun.    All I remember was thinking -  MUST HAVE BUFFALO WINGS .  I was salivating at the thought.  Side note - I've been on a no-carb/no-sugar/no-grease diet for over a month now.  But I was eatin' me some buffalo wings...lol.  We get to the bar and a bunch of chicks are having a bachelorette party.  On a Tuesday?  Instantly Layla jumps up and parties with them.  Doing the bump and the do-si-do with the bride-to-be.  Meanwhile, Evermean and I are in the smooch zone.  For some reason, we love PDAs while drunk.  Tini just sat there and watched us like we were maniacs.  Most of the night there was a blur.  I do remember going back home and burning some trees.  That's like pouring lemon juice on a cut.  Yeh asshole, drink MD and chief a little.  I was a sight for sore eyes boy.  Me and Layla!  Of course, Evermean was too drunk to realize we'd snuck off.   Tini sat there again...and watched us try to kill ourselves.    Layla and I were HAMMERED.  At one point we went in pre-freakout mode awf da, "I done did too much!"..lmao.  I'll say.  An hour later, we went our seperate ways.  Evermean was looking at me like I was a brand new rollercoaster ride...grinnin and shit.  Awf da tiddly wink status and I'm lookin' at her all victimized cuz I'm too effed up to defend myself.    I woke up this morning, naked, awf da.."Where I'm iz?"  LOL!    Thanks Mad Dog.  Never again son.  Belee dat!!!!
