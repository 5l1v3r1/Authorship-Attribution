MAKE IT STOP PLEASE!!!!     urlLink She keeps calling me dammit!  After over an hour of talking myself out of going there with her, she keeps taking over my mind!  Plus her petty ass done dispatched the Stomach Department and told them to use all forces if I don't comply.  Now I feel threatened so I'mma go head and meet  urlLink them  around the corner.  If I don't she'll page me or even go extra hard and call the CEO of the Brain Department and he'll put me in a trance and have me catch a shoplifting charge at my job.  Can't have that.  I've been given instructions to "break the seal" cuz it's "crunch time".  I'll see what that means when I return from my mission.  I know I should've gone with  urlLink Chester  and them.  I heard they come in peace, unlike this hoebag.  Plus he wears Jordan's.  Oh well, cover me..I'm going in!!!!!!!
