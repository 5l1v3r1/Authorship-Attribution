Thug Heathens   Last Saturday my dad had a gospel concert at my childhood church.  Lemme explain.  The church I grew up in was what black folks call HOLINESS.  It's one of those places where the people get "happy".  I'm not going to go all into it, but if you know what I'm talking about then you feel me on this one.  My brother, sisters, Evermean and I all went including my mom and other folks.  My brother had a friend there with him who I'm assuming never been to a church like that.  Anyway there was a band up there playing one of those toe-stomping upbeat songs and somebody caught the spirit.  Of course the lady who was "touched" was doing what people usually do when they get the holy ghost.  My brother's friend busted out really loud....'MAAAAAAN LOOK AT DAT LADY OVER THERE CRIPWALKING!!!"   Nona  I had to share.
