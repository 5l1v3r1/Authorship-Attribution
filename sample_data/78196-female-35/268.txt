Best Response   As you know, we watched Claudine last night.  Evermean had never seen it, so I had her watch it with me.  I know some of you don't think blaxploitation movies from the 70's are funny.  Fuck that shit!  Claudine is hilarious man.  If you were poor in the 70's, you'll find Claudine to be a riot.  So yeh, we were watching it and there were some funny assed quotes on there man.  Who wrote those scripts?  Prolly a freak!     Anyway, Claudine's oldest daughter got caught creeping in the house, drunk, late one night.  When Claudine asked her why in the hell she was hanging out wiff Abdulla (her boyfriend), the daughter's response was, "HE TEACH ME HOW TO MEET PEOPLE AND HOLD MY LIQUOR MAMMA"  Claudine goes (while daughter is throwing up), "Well, he didn't do a good dayumed job!"  Why the daughter say, "I'M ONLY ON MY FIRST LESSON"  Evermean almost chucked that cookie outta her mouf laughin awf dat.  What a great comeback.  I'm thinking if Evermean ever catches me cheating (which I'll never do), that's what my excuse will be.  "UM...She teach me how to meet people and hold my liquor!"..LOL!!  For the record, I don't need nobody to teach me either one.  lol   I'm tellin' yall right now, if you ever watch Claudine, please note that James Earl Jones will make you loose your lunch.  Ugh!  His chest hair looks like taco meat ...LOL.  Evermean and I went to sleep exhausted from laughing at this dumb asses flick.
