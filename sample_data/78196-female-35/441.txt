Criminal Minded       &nbsp;   I know we're all supposed to be upright citizens and everything, but I'm telling you, these spyware mofos make you wanna cut somebody.&nbsp; My computer is like Ft. Knox (or so I thought), running 2 firewalls, virus software of which I update every single week, pop-up blockers, and proxy abilities.&nbsp; Do you&nbsp; know these fuckers STILL get spyware and malware in my shit?!!&nbsp; WTF??!!!! &nbsp;    I am so mad.&nbsp; I see imma hafta holla at my hacker pal and maybe launch some shit back at the bitches that send that shit out.&nbsp; They are really that pressed to sell you something that they'd rather crash your browser to get a fucking point across.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Imma start with these buttfucks and then I'll work on the fucking junk mail assholes who clutter up our mailbox with 'Bad Credit?' and 'We Buy Foreclosed Homes' bullshit.&nbsp; Obviously, if a person doesn't solicit YOU...LEAVE 'EM THE FUCK ALONE.     &nbsp;   The do-not-call list is cool, but we also need these lists:     &nbsp;   Do not mail    Do not email    Do not leave shit about yo' club in my windshield    Do not sell me pocketbooks in the hair salon    Do not offer me pre-paid legal    Do not ask me if I want a WatchTower    Do not ask me fo' shit    Do not get on my nerves today     &nbsp;   SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING!!!    This shit is crazy.
