urlLink The Friday Five     1. What's your favorite vacation spot?  Hedonism in Negril, Jamaica.  I can't even describe the mayhem and naked tomfoolery that goes on down there.  That was the best!  (and i partied naked...lol)  2.  Where do you consider to be the biggest hell-hole on earth?  The unemployment office   3. What would be your dream vacation?  Vegas.  I'm a party animal.  That's sin city.  You do the math.   4. If you could go on a road-trip with anyone, who would it be and why?  I would go on a road trip with four people: Chris Tucker, Michael Jackson, Kid Rock, and Elmo.  That shit would be a scream.  Can you see us now?  I'd have someone to laugh at, someone to get drunk with, and someone to torture Elmo by hanging his head out da window (doin a hunnit mph).  That's what I call a roadtrip, for real.     5. What are your plans for this weekend?   I was gonna go to a chick party but I don't feel like it.  I'll prolly just sit at home and think of stupid shit to tell yall.  Not really feelin' this weekend for some reason.
