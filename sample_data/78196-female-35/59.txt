What the hell is wrong with me?      My mom and dad weren't perfect ,  but still you don't hear no cryin ass bitchin from me,  like there seems to be on everybody's CD  so just sit back and relax and let me have your head for a minute,  I can show you something in it,  that has yet to be presented.     Why have I clouded up my mind ,  why's my mother always right,  and will I make it?  Fill the end or will I crawl away and die.  Click, Click, Boom!     Boy if I had a pistol right now.  (sigh)
