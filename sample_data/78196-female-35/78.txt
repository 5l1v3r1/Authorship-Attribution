I Feel So Alive!   Aw shucks, I'm aight now.  I done got myself together but I bet you it was that turkey and cheddar sammich I had for lunch.  I soaked up all that rotgut I drank last night.  Now I feel alive, inspired, cheeky!  Yes!  Somebody find my clutch!  I'm ready to MARCH baby!  Now I'm listening to house music on internet radio, bobbin' my head cuz baby I'm back.  I wonder what my techno-dwarves would do if I jumped up on this desk and raised up.  Wavin my pockeybook around my head like a helicopter.  I sure could use a raise-up man cuz I'm feeling sooo much better.  Woo.  I'm glad I dried out cuz tonight Imma git fried out.     My house sister, Persia dedicated today to me.  Thanks Persia, wiff yo fine self.  I luh yoo man!  She so dayum pretty I wanna smack her.  If she wasn't my "sista", I think I'd try to chase her around the coffee table, like a helicopter..LOL  Persia?  Wanna ride in my heli?  Don't be scurred.  But yeh she's so sweet.  She would be the head of our NY chapter.  The queen diva of the cit-ay.  I think today I'll dedicate to Ned da Whino cuz I felt his pain this morning.  Here's to you Ned!!
