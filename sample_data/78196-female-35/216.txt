Funny Quote    Yall know I just love my fellow blogger,  urlLink Alissa .  She's funny as hell and also had an interesting family-oriented weekend.  I just read it and literally fell out laughing at this: "these people had the audacity to talk about how i don't eat. um... hello. YOU CAN'T COOK. i'd rather eat a heaping spoonful of flaming dog shit." That shit is funny.  Don't worry Alissa, you've got people out here who are amazed by the way you communicate.  To hell wiff anybody who don't like it.  Keep ranting, girl....
