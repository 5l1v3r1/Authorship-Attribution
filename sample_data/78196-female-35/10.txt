I heard something really interesting tonight.  I was watching Family Guy and the baby is off the chain! He favors my nephew, Niko when he was like two years old, a big head very little hair and cornrows...LOL!  The baby's name is  urlLink Stewie  of all things, and his mouth is razor sharp.  The sister dissed the hell out of the A.V. dude at her school because he was horribly challenged in the grill department.  So after discovering the "carry", he tells her, "I'm just a piece of  urlLink eye candy  turned into an  urlLink all-day sucker !"  I thought that shit was funny.  That's how I've felt in these awful experiences we call relationships.  Simply a piece of eye candy at first and then BOOM!  I'm a bonafied SUCKA!
