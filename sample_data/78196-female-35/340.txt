Sunshine Days   My roommate, Sunshine, is off the hook!  I never really gave yall an update on how shit been rollin' with her.  She's funny as fuck!  Why did she tell me and Tini that she got shagged in a broomcloset...AT A WEDDING?!!  She goes, "Ohmygod!  I can't believe I actually hooked up in a broom closet!  How lame is that?!  Great.  I'm a fucking trailerpark slut!"  *dead*  Tini and I fell out.  Then she proceeded to tell us about her best friend who spent a week with us last month.  She said that this hoebag hooked up a few times during her first visit to DC.  Once was in a public bathroom when she gave head to two guys.  I swear I wish yall could see this chick.  Talk about mousey and innocent looking.  Looks can sure fool ya!  Sunshine is chill though.  She was telling us how she's been on Ritilin since 7th grade.  Wow.  And she still has some.  Honestly, she's a good kid.  Just a little wired, I guess.  She parties harder than Tini and I.  Happy Hour every night and drunken stupors all weekend.  Plus she smokes down!  We love her!   I'm sure her family back in Oregon have no idea that she's livin it up in DC.  They'd definitely freak out.
