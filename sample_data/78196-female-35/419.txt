Come Inside       I know all have sinned and come short of his glory I'm just glad that I'm here to tell the story  I coulda been dead sleeping in my grave But God blessed me to see another day Even when I did wrong He was still there I'm so glad that God still hears a sinner's prayer......

Written by Evanescence    Oh Lord, Thou knowest me Please touch my heart And set me free  I know I've done wrong But it's been so long Don't forget about me.....   Written, copywritten and published by my mom    I have no idea why I posted this.  Just a few lyrics that have been leaning on my heart today.   It happens like that sometimes.
