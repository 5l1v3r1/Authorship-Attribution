The  urlLink Friday Five     1. If you could eat dinner with and "get to know" one famous person (living or dead), who would you choose?  Etta James.  She's my favorite   2. Has the death of a famous person ever had an effect on you? Who was it and how did you feel?   Can't think of one [I wont say Aaliyah..too easy].  Right now, I'm effected by the death of my Sim, Hailey Joe Slutbag.  I can't figure out what killed her ass.     3. If you could BE a famous person for 24 hours, who would you choose?  I would wanna be Li'l Romeo.
