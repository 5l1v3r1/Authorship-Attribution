The Best Gift A Girl Can Ask For   I just want to add that I got the best gift I could ever ask for this year.  Vida Verde paid me a visit just to share some of her life-changing decisions.  I was soooooo happy and proud of her.  My prayers were answered and my faith proved that she'd be okay.  Vida's one of my favorite people in the world and I love her to pieces, man.  My year ended on a good note because she did something so positive for herself.  Even though it's a little scary at first, I see all good things for her in the future.  Now I have someone to look up to (cuz my ass is still a heathen..lol) and I know that she'll be an asset to all who experience her power.  Vida! Hang in there and always know that I'm here for you.  CONGRATULATIONS!  mwah!
