For three years now, I've been trying to get over someone.  It never fails.  Whenever you feel like you've crawled out of the emotional hell that the scars of love have left you with, someone writes a song:   Never made it as a wise man I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing Tired of living like a blind man I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling And this is how you remind me This is how you remind me Of what I really am This is how you remind me Of what I really am   It's not like you to say sorry I was waiting on a different story This time I'm mistaken for handing you a heart worth breaking and I've been wrong, i've been down, to the bottom of every bottle it's the words in my head scream "are we having fun yet?"   yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no   it's not like you didn't know that I said I love you and I swear I still do And it must have been so bad Cause living with me must have damn near killed you   And this is how, you remind me Of what I really am This is how, you remind me Of what I really am   THANKS A LOT  urlLink NICKELBACK!
