Song Dedication    This song goes out to the fucktards on Black Planet who be on that bamma shit (they know who they are):    I'm so tired, of playing Playing with this bow and arrow Gonna give my heart away Leave it to the other girls to play For I've been a temptress too long  From this time, unchained We're all looking at a different picture Thru this new frame of mind A thousand flowers could bloom Move over, and give us some room  So don't you stop, being a man Just take a little look from our side when you can Sow a little tenderness No matter if you cry  Give me a reason to love you Give me a reason to be a woman Its all I wanna be is all woman  For this is the beginning of forever and ever  Its time to move over... ...   The song is called Glory Box by  urlLink Portishead .  Oh yeh, thanks Damon for lending me your ear.  'ppreciate dat man.  :-)
