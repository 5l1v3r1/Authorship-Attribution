R.I.P. Melanie Thornton     I cannot believe yet  urlLink another person has died from a plane crash !  What the hell??!!  Melanie Thornton was the chick from the dance group La Bouche who sang lead.  Maaaan back in the early 90's when I was an even worse club head and party animal (while living in Baltimore), I used to love  Be My Lover .  That used to be my get-ready-for-the-club song man!  She had a pretty decent voice too and in fact, she just released her debut album,   urlLink Ready to Fly  ...ooooh how eerie is that?  That's awful.     I don't care if I gotta ride a rat to work, a big girl aint gonna be flying no time soon.  Enough is a fucking 'nuff!
