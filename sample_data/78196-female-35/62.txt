Lint Balls   I am so broke right now it ain't even funny.  How did this happen?  Let's see....AW HELL I don't friggin' know.  I've gotta make 20 bux stretch until Friday.  That's really sad.  What am I gonna  urlLink do for lunch? I swear this is awful  I am the worst money manager in the whole world.  And to depress myself even further, I decided to take the  urlLink  What Kind of Animal Are You   test.  I regret to report that I am a combination of a vulture, zebra, and a hippo.  How'd they know that?  I guess they're right.  I am a quarter mixed breed (blk/wht) hippo with buzzard syndrome.  That's just great folks!  There goes my self-esteem.   How bout I skip lunch today and just reflect on the fatness.  Or perhaps ponder on how I target love junkies like me and then "eat 'em" when they're weak.  Oh yeh, that's a clue!
