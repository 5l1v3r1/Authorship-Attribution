South Beach Savage   I went to Miami last weekend.  Alone.  Pretty much jumped on a plane and went down south.  Originally to do a favor for a friend...like bidness.  But as we all know, I'd find some shit to get into.  I arrived Saturday morning and went to my hotel room that my friend got for me.  WOW!  A 180-degree view of Biscayne Bay up on the top floor of the hotel.   After picking myself up off the floor dancing around like my name was Sooner, I went downstairs and started doing what I went there to do.   I mat up with a group of ladies who insisted upon taking me down to South Beach for drinks.  One problem.  Five words.  A sexy, Cuban, hot tamale.  I'll call her Tamalia...hell.  She was the ringleader.    I hadn't slept in three days because I've had work work to do for my real job.  So yall know I'm delirious.  After a power nap and a Red Bull, I was rhet ta go.   Tamalia picks me up in her hiked up blue bullet, and we pushed it on down to S.B.  Why oh why did they have a Wet Willies down there?  Why?  Parked it right there.  All imma say to yall is I had three large cups of  Call A Cabs .  NONA   Oh yeh.  Truly OFF MY FACE.  I had the wobbly boot on.  The asshole show begins.    Tamalia is off her rocker and I was playing a sick game called  Follow the Leader
