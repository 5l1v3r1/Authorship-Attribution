She's 4 Today!!!       My little stinky butt has a birthday today.  She's a Halloween baby!  Tonight, my sister is giving her her very first Halloween Birthday BASH with all the trimmings.  The star diva herself, Tayah, will dazzle her guests as she makes her grand entrance as a CHEETAH GIRL.  Yes.  They got her.  "Cheetah" has done some ill mind control via the  urlLink TV  and my neice is a huge fan.  Awf da, "CHEETAH POWER!"  Li'l sis didn't want to glorify the real meaning of Halloween so she decided to make it a positive, colorful and FUN birthday for Tayah.  All us adults have to work as hostesses and yes....we gots to dress up.  As of this very hour, I have no costume.  Heck, everything I own is fetish, adult, and just plain offensive..lmao.  You can tell what kind of parties I'm used to attending.  Every dayumed novelty outfit in my closet is PVC, fishnet or tight with stripper shoes to match.  Soooooo inappropriate!  In fact, I went home last night to rummage through my closet.  Unfortunately, I can't use one stitch.  Off I'll go to the store (as my usual last minute self) and find SOMETHING.  Maybe I'll live out my fantasy and be a pageant mom.  I'll wear a baseball cap with fake oversized rhinestone studs, and a velvet sweatsuit to match.  Rock some dayumed Keds with MORE PLASTIC rhinestones glued on em.  LOT'S OF COLORS.  Wear extra extra jewelry, heavy perfume and Tammy Faye makeup.  Walk around with a toolbelt full of glittery makeup stuff, a powder puff, a cell phone, a note pad and a jumbo can of Aquanet.  LOL  Spend my evening primping and fussing over all the little girls.  "REMEMBER YOUR LINES!!!!  WATCH YOUR POSTURE!!!"    LOL  I have NO idea what I'm really going to do.  I have 6 hours to make it happen.
