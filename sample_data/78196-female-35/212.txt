Today's Dedication   Imma dedicate today to my brother,  urlLink BlkCastro (on the right).  He celebrated his 29th birthday yesterday.  I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate me telling the world he got his "mista" stuck in the vacuum, but what the hell.  Happy birthday fat boy!  Luh yoo man.     Oh yeh, by the way.  The House of Martini (our house) is hosting a party for his birthday.  Oh God! My sister called me and asked if they can use our fabulous downtown apartment for a party with strippers.  I can see it now.  The House of Martini turned into the House of Ill Repute (again).  Strippers, ballers, gangstas, and hoes.  Perfect.  I want a front seat...LOL  Yall know imma post about the aftermath of this party.  I can't wait (and I gotta web cam too).  This could be very good.
