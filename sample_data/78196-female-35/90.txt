SHE'S FREE!!!    My sister was freed yesterday morning.  What's funny is, she wasn't ready to come home yet..LOL.  Turns out, she got in and started her own mob of new chicks.  Apparently, the ladies who were booked with her all decided to create an alliance in case the "bad girls" on lockdown tried to do them in.  According to her, the alliance consisted of an O.G. (bad ass chick who's been locked up several times), a young Indian girl (got nabbed for shoplifting bras), and two Black chicks (just wrong place at the wrong time).  Banned together they decided to take prison by storm and basically stomp the cowboy shit out of anyone who got in their way (can you say Survivor).  Once my sister was "processed" she realized that a few of her homies were in there.  That's all she needed to see.  For two days, my sister lived the prison life..and HAD A BALL!  She said she passed notes and various beauty products under her door and did pushups (she said jail aint jail until you do pushups).   Then yesterday, she went out like Ms. Lock-Down 2001, blowing kisses and exchanging prison numbers, telling her "homies" that she'd be back to show luv.  My sister is officially off the leash!
