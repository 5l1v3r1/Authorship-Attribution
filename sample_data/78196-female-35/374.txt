BITTER    So where were you?  When all this I was going through  You never took the time  To ask me just what you could do     I only know that I can change  Everything else just stays the same  So now I step out of the darkness  that my life became 'cause    I don't give a fuck   About all of your problems   I could give a rats ass   how your feeling today   take your wordly advice   and shove it straight up your ass   Thanks for coming around   to fuck up my day          Dedicated to my ex-gf.  I really don't have time for this.  Let it be.  Let me be.  Live your life.  Period.
