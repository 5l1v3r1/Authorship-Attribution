Today's Dedication      NORMA RAE is who I'm dedicating today to.  Considering the fact that my job has not paid me for three, count 'em, three weeks, I'm going out like NORMA on dey asses!!!  First, it's bad enough I'm the only female in this room full of khaki-clad techno dwarves and I don't even have my own cube.  I now have to work week after week with NO MONEY coming my way.  I'm being pimped yall.  I'm in a "tech room" so it sort of looks like a classroom in here and I'm surrounded by men.  Now I have to continue this cake job while I watch the techno dwarves go to lunch, buy cigs and shit like that.  What am I doing?  FIGHTING OFF PIERCING HUNGER CRAMPS cuz my ass is broke.  As bad as the economy is, I can't afford to work and not be paid.     Turns out, my agency messed up my time and processed payroll late.  Okay, late means one week, BUT IT'S BEEN ALMOST THREE!!  So I've decided that if no paychecks show up tomorrow, they will NOT see me after Thanksgiving.  They can thank me for giving them free work for three weeks okay?!!  They can thank me for NOT giving them an ass-whipping aight?  I'm not showing up for work until I see JUSTICE!!  Thanks Norma!!!!
