Princess of the Rings   I finally decided to join two blog rings I've been casing.    BlackBlogz ..back dere  <---- and CocoaBlogz.   The thing is, I had to send in a request to be accepted into CocoaBlogz.  Maybe I'll get in!  I'll soon be a star!  Man I wish they'd accept audition tapes.  I used to be a home video hoe back in the day.  Got a good one of me lapdancing in a gravel pit wearing a hard hat.  Plus I was barefoot.  It doesn't look like they want tape submissions.  Just a simple email.  I sent one.  We'll see if they open the do' for me.  Right now I'm still standing here getting doormat prints in my feets.  It's cold out here all by myself.  Hold me I'm scared!
