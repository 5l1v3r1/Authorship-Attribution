My Poor Sister   She needs a hug.  On her  urlLink blog , she wrote,  "Oh If yall find the bamma that stole my heart tell him its on.. ".   Her poor little jaded heart.  I should register a new domain name and call it www.boyfriendsareahoax.com or www.dontgointothelightcarolanne.com  or how about www.harpobeatme.com     I need to rebuke all past relationship demons.  Let's all invoke the spirits of all women who've been hurt and haunt these motherfuckers for life (note: I'm listening to  I'm Bad  by LL Cool J)!  I should get my sister and dress up in a Kangol and some raspberry Lee jeans wiffa big assed wallet in my back pocket, rockin' shell-topped Adidas, and a tight assed white BVD.  I'll bust up in dere wiff my Cool J Cookies balled up in my fist yellin, DONT CALL IT A COMEBACK..I'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS!  Then smack the hell out of all of my ex's.  The mere thought gives me chills.  Don't let go GI JANE!!!!
