Rock Head   I've become a rock music fanatic.  Incubus, Staind, The Deftones, Disturbed, Fuel, and Alice In Chains have SAVED MY LIFE for the past year.  I wanted to badly to go see Incubus, but they've been sold out forever.  Been forced to settle for Pink.  Yeh....we're all going to see her on June 4th at the Nation.  That should be a blast.  I'm starting to get into Marilyn Manson, Ozzy, and Kid Rock now.....scary.  Before yall say sumpthin....these fools be having shit to say.  And I so feel them.
