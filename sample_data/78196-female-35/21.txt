Why is it that when we see an ex, we have to check ourselves to make sure we feel cute?  Why?  What does it matter how cute you feel?  I mean granted, my outfit is pretty cute today and I'm having a fair hair day, but still.  Why did I have to go look at myself in the mirror and tighten up my grill just to see him?  Should it not matter what he thinks?  So my weak ass went to meet my ex a little while ago but I had to make sure I looked extra cute.  Even though we had a nice conversation and he flirted a little bit, I still feel like a  urlLink JERK  cuz I cared.  I don't know.  To hell with it.
