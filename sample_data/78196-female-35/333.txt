What Had Happened Mike?   Am I the only person who believes the fight was rigged?  Am I the only one who thinks Mike Tyson WANTED TO LOSE so he could prove himself as being a functional adult and later get his license back in Vegas?  There is no way in the world that he could get creamed like that.  That fool didn't throw ONE PUNCH in like 4 rounds!  What da?  I'm sitting at a fight party and couldn't believe my eyes!  He got a old-fashioned ass whuppin'.  Lewis is good and his arms are long as hell, but um...c'mon son!  That was ridiculous!  I was so mad that Mike aint fight back, I coulda "eaten his children myself"..LOL  Sike..dass nasty..LOL.    I don't know but um..I hope Lewis falls for the "Please let me fight you again.  You're a most masterful fighter." bullshit.  Maybe then, Mike will make it worth the money.  Glad I didn't pay for it.  And especially glad I got drunk.  Speaking of drunk.  You know you are a drunk when you go to a party and meet a few people who, assuming you hadn't met before, and one guy says, "I know you.  You don't remember me last time cuz your ass was drunk!"...LMAO.  Lawd.  The party I went to was all guys.  I didn't seem to care cuz that's not what I'm into.  Before leaving, I told them all it was nice meeting them and apparently, I'd met one dude a few years ago and he's awf da, "Man, you a wild girl!"  Then another guy there knew some of my folks.  He hit me wit da, "Oh!  You're so in so's sister.  I heard about your crazy ass!"  I need to slow down..LOL  By the way, the fight right before the main event where the little Viet dude beat the crap out of homeboy was funny as hell.
