Just The Facts         I went thru it......   The week before Christmas - horrifying.  Evermean and I had the biggest fight in history.   Christmas - great.  Got to make my neice and nephews happy.  New Years Eve - that's when it all started...  Depression hit me like a locomotive.  Blew a load of money on bullshit shopping trying to diffuse it.  Hmph.  Ebay made a killing!  Got some kick-ass boots though.  No help.  Just ended up broke.  Became and emotionally unstable recluse for a period of about 2 weeks.  COMPLETE HELL.  Hated everything.  Battled with insomnia and feelings of incredibly low self worth.   urlLink He  tried to make me do it.  End it all.  Wouldn't.  Then it got personal.  He started trying to mess with things close to me.  Petty bastard.  Evermean and I stopped communicating cuz I shut down. One of my closest friends was depressed as well.  We've were there for each other.  I love you SEVEN.   My cousin actually did take a bottle of pills and ended up in the hospital. Dad sustained a leg injury that resulted in him not being able to walk temporarily. Tayah's father up and moved to SC.  Didn't even say goodbye to his own baby.  She didn't take it too well. I found a tiny lump.  No comment. My doctor of over 10 yrs. retired unbeknownst to me. Gained back the few pounds I'd lost. Drank and smoked like Janis Joplin. Got back in touch with my God Daughter (it's been like 7 yrs).  She and I rebonded but I learned she got preg. in high school, dropped out, and now has a criminal record.  Great.   Was paying on a car that we'd gotten from someone.  It was later stripped down to the frame.      Decided to talk to God.  For obvious reasons.  Glad I did.  Here's why...(besides the obvious):  I got an excellent offer at work.  More money!!!! Evermean got promoted. Mom did too. Cousin didn't die.  He's better now.  For the past week, it's been God, Fiona Apple and Nikka Costa.  Just us.  The only ones who understand my pain.  What I was feeling.    Then last week..  Evermean and I went to a store which will remain unnamed.  It got held up at gunpoint with us in there.  The wild part about it is the "bad guys" were already inside and had everybody on the floor when we walked in.  They were so busy taking stuff, they didn't hear or see us come in.  Nor did we notice anything was going on when we got there. We made it to the back of the store right before more customers entered.   They, unfortunately, got guns drawn on them too.  The entire time, we're in the back, scared shitless, and the robbers (two with guns) never knew we were there.  We just stood in complete silence and horror for about 10 minutes while listening to them give orders to others.  They left.  But with cash, everyone's IDs and/or credit cards.  We were spared completely.  Evermean and I got TWO cars for cheaper then the one we were originally buying.   My Dad is back to normal. I've mended my ill feelings towards my ex-gf.  We're friends again.  Even better friends than when we were together. Evermean and I talked everything out.  Things are wonderful again.  And... We just celebrated another anniversary. My sister has been in Los Angeles for the past 5 days.  She had meetings with some industry folks and received a small contract to perform in a huge show.    My brother and new wife have a new baby girl on the way.    This huge burden has been lifted without me even trying.  It just disappeared.  I feel much better.  No matter how low I was and how horrible things all around me were, God never left my side.  It was incredibly evident and still is right now.     Consider that my testimony.   Thanks for the emails and posts to my site.  I'm working on a new layout right now and will soon change to my new domain: endlesscalamity.com.
