Night Watch   Why can't I sleep?  Insomnia is a petty bitch.  This would be yet another night of me being up until sunrise.  Evermean conks out at around midnight, Mawny tries to hang up with me too.  Don't work.   I'm usually up in the middle of the night either being disturbed by disfunctional B movies on cable or talking to some psychopath online.    The Sims have got me on lock!  I've built better relationships on that than in my real life.  It's so funny to see them fight with each other.  I have so many Sims that I tend to forget who is with who.  Until one night one of my Simchix got all the shit slapped out of her.  I kept trying to put 'Attack' but the game let her get her ass beat.  That's shady EA Sports.  I want my Sims to defend themselves.  Maybe I'll create a gang family and stir up some violence.  That'll be funny.
