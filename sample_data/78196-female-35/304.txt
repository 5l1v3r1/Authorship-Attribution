La Vida de Drama   Shit sux.  Mom's sick (again).  Evermean thinks she effed up (again)...so not the case.  I'm borderline bipolar...lol.  Lauryn Hill's Unplugged provoked thought that I didn't necessarily wanna face.  Have taken the first step towards making amends with my sister (before I snap her neck).  This will be my last attempt at trying to understand and get along with her.  I called her yesterday to set up a meeting and she was awf da, "what I do now?!".  Um..shaddup ponk, just show up mkay?   I love her, but sometimes I wanna kick her in the chin.  She's not a girl, but not yet a woman.  Yall feel me?  Her shit don't stink (apparently), so imma show her somma my shit...damnit.  My other sister (the baby) is going with us to Savannah (again).  Evermean and I scored a video camera...aw lawd..lol.   We plan on videotaping errything.  I don't think I'll post videos online, but pictures definitely.      urlLink Tiffani  asked me how Evermean got her name.  Before I explain that, I must explain our "house".  For those of you who don't know, it's the House of Martini.  That's how I got my name.  The HOM is basically a group of friends who "borrowed" the Paris is Burning concept of "houses".  Yall know how some of the "boys" set up houses of fabulousness and basically rename themselves.  That's what we did.  The House of Martini is a group of likeminded chicks who fit the Five B's of Fabulousness (can't share)..lol.  There's Tini, Persia, Magenta, Evermean, and Nona.  We had naming ceremonies to come up with our names.  Tini, Persia and I chose our own names.  Nona comes from Nona Hendrix.  I used to love her as a kid.  I thought she was sexy, dominant, and a cross between a man, woman, and cyborg freak (basically me) and she dressed her ass off and said whatever the hell she wanted.  Magenta and Evermean were our last two members.  Magenta is our "spiritual guide" sort of.  She's got supernatural abilities so we decided to give her a gypsy name like Magenta.  As for Evermean.  Well, she's a sweetheart for real, but her pseudo-personality is so funny.  She be awf da redneck, tabacco chewin' shit talkin...lol.. Always asking, "Who mess wiff you?  Don't make me kick dey ass"..LOL  When I first met her, I thought she was one of the cutest, sweetest women I've ever seen.  Once I got to know her, I realized that though very giving and nice, she'll kick somebody's ass quick..lol  That's so funny to me.  With her little 5 foot 4 self.  She's just basically overprotective of anyone she cares about.  But the way she handles it, is so effin funny.  For instance, last year in Savannah one of our friends turned up missing.  Basically, she ran off drunk with some unknown guy and never returned home.  Once she got back, she and the guy were laid up in the bed drunk.  Evermean was so pissed that our friend had scared the piss outta all of us (cuz we thought she was really missing), she busted in the hotel room, took one look at the dude and said, "Who the hell are you?!  I don't care who you are, but you got to get the fuck out right now. When I get back, you betta be gone or your ass is mine!".  All of us nosey girls are lookin at her with our mouths wide open like we can't believe she just threatened to beat this guys ass (who was twice her size and had a friend outside).  She then took our friend in the bathroom and jacked her up so bad that the poor girl was calling the airport to get the hell outta there.  She was crying so hard, she was shaking.  Meanwhile, ol' boy packed his shit and rolled out..LOL.  That shit was so funny.  I'd never seen Evermean so mad.  So Tini and I were watching the Wiz one night and Evilene's sister's name was Evermean.  We thought, PERFECT.  That's her "house" name.  She didn't like it at first, but once we explained everything, she was fine with it.        Last year in Savannah, all types of shit broke out.  My sister and another one of our friends beat up a girl and her husband.  I passed out twice in front of a hotel (slobbing on myself wiff no shoes)..lol,  and every last one of us were pissy drunk.  We all came back with lots of beads (works like Mardi Gras).  I sang, All Cried Out by Lisa Lisa at a kareoke bar awf da talking about men aint shit..lol.  We showed tits, butts, kissed old nasty men, humped strangers, all that shit.  I can't wait to post my Savannah blog.  That shit's gonna be funny.
