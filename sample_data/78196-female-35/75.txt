urlLink This makes me sick .  Which explains why I'm against war.  Yes, we had a major tragedy where thousands died, but it's still no excuse for bombing the houses of innocent people in the middle of the night.  That makes me sick to my stomach.  Before, the US was attacked by a "faceless coward" for (at the time) reasons unknown.  But we on the other hand, announced our terror in Afghanistan.  We told them we were coming and then bombed the hell out of them, killing innocent people.  That makes us no different, I'm sorry.  I'm all for punishing those who were responsible for the 9/11 tragedy, but I cannot understand why we need to kill those caught in the crossfire.  It's just not fair.
