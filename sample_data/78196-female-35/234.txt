Funny Quote   I was reading this  urlLink article  about a Canadian's take on wierd America.  How funny is this?   "But my most unusual memory of Tulsa is of a small bar I was introduced to. The main point of interest hung over the bar itself, about 10 feet off the ground -- an absolutely huge moose head, complete with an impressive array of antlers. Over the years, the owner has managed to accumulate a collection of over 200 bras. They're now draped over this moose. I guess you could say the moose has a nice rack."
