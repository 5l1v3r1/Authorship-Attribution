Today's Dedication     I feel like I in the middle of a battle between good and evil.  Seriously.  One day, I'm fine.  The next day I feel like puking out the insides of this worthless body.  So instead of having my first official pass-out of 2002, I decided to listen to some music and chill.  I paid attention to the words of  Innocent  by  urlLink Fuel .  Because of what the songs says, I'm dedicating today to them.  The lyrics are:     Satan, you know where I lie  Gently I go into that good night  All our lives get complicated  Search for pleasures overrated  Never armed our souls  What the future would hold  When we were innocent  Angels, lend me your might  Forfeit all my lives to get just one right  All those colors long since faded  All our smiles are confiscated  Never were we told  What the future would hold  When we were innocent    This prayer is for me tonight  This far down that line and still ain't got it right    And while confessions not yet stated  Our next sin is contemplated  Never did we know  What the future would hold  Or that we'd be bought and sold   When we were innocent
