Misinformed      How come nobody told me?  Why didn't I know?  Maaaaann.   urlLink This  is what I'm talking about!    Lemme explain.  Evermean has been a little under the weather for the past week or so.  She's been poppin Halls like candy.  Last night.  All imma say is.....WHY DIDN'T I KNOW ABOUT THIS SHIT??!  Man, I felt like I wanted to conquer the Swiss Alps and be awf da slolem like Suzy ("Chapstick") Chaffee on dat ass. I wanted to stand up on the mattress, declaring my devotion to mentholyptus with a Peppermint Patty hangin out my mouth!  Now I know the secret (although delayed)...lol. Those little drops are responsible for some pretty amazing things with regard to the privates. I wonder what icy hot will do?  Or what if I go buy the real menthoyptus plant and rub my stuff wiffit?  Prolly sizzle my little man in the boat.  LMAO.  Halls be where it's at yall.   Am I just old or did I miss something?
