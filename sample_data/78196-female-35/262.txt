Today's Dedication     I'm dedicating today to Ms.  urlLink Cece Peniston  baby!  Her song,  Inside That I Cried  is the fucking bomb!  Why did Tini buy her greatest hits CD?  We listened to that song and I swear that's how I feel.  I can't just ponk out and boo hoo my friggin eyes out so instead I cry on da inside like Ce Ce.  If you could look inside this ol' chest cavitah, you'd see major tears, man.  Everything from V-Day memories to UNEMPLOYMENT, I'm wailin!  On the outside, I'm Stone Cold Nona, grinnin', bloggin', and livin'.  Imma be aight doe.  I think I may be forced to strip at a roadside truck stop.  That'll score me some regular cash.  Either that or get me some hoes...LMAO.  Any takers?  I'm gon' start taking applications...LOL  You can have your own room and I'll even feed you. All you gotta do is WORK.  lol  That's after I have atcha awf da turnout.  Here's to you Ce Ce!   You betta sang girl!
