I feel so ugly and worthless today.  First of all, I didn't carry my dilapidated ass to work.  Why?  Cuz my boss done turned me into a nonfunctional loser at work.  So I get up this morning and decide fuck it, I aint goin in.  Laid my happy ass down and now I'm spending a beautiful day all by myself at home feeling absolutely horrible.  I haven't had a shower since yesterday, my bush is seriously misunderstood, and I gotta bad attitude.  I'm so bitter, I can't even take advantage of this opportunity and beat awf..lol.  Cuz I can't stand my sickening self.  Oh life is so unfair!
