Today's Dedication   I'm dedicating today to my MOTHER. Today is her birthday.  She's 53.  I'm so blessed to still have my mom (and dad).  And she's even more blessed to reach 53.  I can't even see myself making it to that age.  Especially considering the current state of affairs.  Anyway, happy birthday ma!  Thank you for being my friend and thank you for raising me this way.  I just love your little face and your antics are the reason why I'm such a nutball (she and my father are household comedians..lol).  All of you who know my mother know that she's one of the sweetest li'l shorties out here.  Call her up and wish her HB.  Today's your day mommy!   Happy Birthday big bay-beh.  **hugs**
