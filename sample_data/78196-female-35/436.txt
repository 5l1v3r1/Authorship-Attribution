Three Words          OBAMA WORKED THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   (wiff his cute self)   **********    I know I'm all late but I had to catch his and Ms. Heinz Kerry's speeches on On Demand tonight.&nbsp; I was speechless.&nbsp; They both had extremely moving things to say.&nbsp; But Mister Obama.&nbsp; He made me git up and do the happy dance.&nbsp; I felt him 100%.    And then...    Lemme say this...    I'm not Greek Orthodox or anything but  urlLink His Excellency, Archbishop Dimitrios'  benediction tonight brought me to TEARS.&nbsp; We needed that! &nbsp;  I swear we did.    Now I gotta wait for  urlLink Al's  speech to rerun.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard he was good too.
