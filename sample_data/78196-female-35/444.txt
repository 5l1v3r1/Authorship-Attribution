Yung Folkz        &nbsp;   Lemme start with these fucktards.&nbsp;     &nbsp;         &nbsp;   I was watching MTV this evening and stumbled upon an episode of Cribs.&nbsp; The Youngbloodz were featured and I couldn't believe what I saw.&nbsp; I thought the show was called Cribs, not Shanties.&nbsp; Man these dudes must be awf dat ill shit or Angel Dust done got dey minds.&nbsp; MTV actually spent money for about 12 minutes of giving the view a tour of a fucking shithole.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Um...YoungBloods??&nbsp; Li'l yunginz... Lemme holla at chall.&nbsp; It's really not cute to give millions of people a tour of yo' crib when it looks like the DEA done raided it.&nbsp; Everything from the furniture to the 'fridge looked like the crackheads said eff it (no pun intended).&nbsp; To me it seems like they are proud of their 'hood or wanna keep it rul or some shit.&nbsp; Um...pumkins..I don't think so.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I came up in what one would consider a 'hood.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp; Typical shit like broke down/child molestor ice cream man, playing double dutch with the water hose, everybody throws trash down the sewer, you had to choose ....an ass whuppin from da bully or suspension from school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's not forget when we appoint somebody to watch da block while we have a cookout.&nbsp; Make sure "jump out" dont roll up on us.&nbsp; &nbsp;And how 'bout each block having the bombest hair dresser?&nbsp; She can do errything from cornrow to weave to make you a prom dress.&nbsp; &nbsp;Dass hoodlife.&nbsp; So I feel it.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; I've lived it.&nbsp; My question is....why do we CHOOSE it?     &nbsp;   Maybe da Youngbloodz didn't have a choice a while back before they busted up from da dirty dirty.&nbsp; But c'mon shawty!&nbsp; Yall are paid now.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can let the pissy mattress go now.&nbsp; Yall can say buh-bye to them dirty assed floor tiles.&nbsp; And tell those milk crates to holla at yall!&nbsp; Them bushy, Shaquana-locked-up-and-I-can't-find-another-hur-dressa cornrows are tired too.&nbsp; You can afford to keep them nice.&nbsp; For rul doe, I took that 'fridgerator personally.&nbsp; That was petty.&nbsp; Yall can at least pay Target or Crate and Barrel a visit.&nbsp; Hell, go to the dollar store (dey be havin' some aight stuff sometimes..lol).&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Seriously though, that was FOUL.&nbsp; Then they had the nerve to have their nephew try feverishly to throw up gang signs.&nbsp; Awf da, "What set you claimin nukka?!!!"&nbsp; Li'l dude couldn't have been older than 3 or 4 years old.&nbsp; It just amazes me.&nbsp; How some folks CHOOSE that ghetto lifestyle like dat shit keeps 'em real.&nbsp; Yeh....my 'hood kept me real too.&nbsp; Real pressed to get the fuck up out dat piece.&nbsp; I honestly could not fathom having to walk over broken bottle, condom packages, and having to read "Cool Disco Dan" written all over my neighborhood.&nbsp; I mean I didn't wanna live like the Huxtables per se.&nbsp; I just wanted to live around HUMANS.&nbsp; Fuck that.&nbsp; And yall can say what you wanna say.&nbsp; I came up in what were considered the projects in the 70s and it was so bad they had to lock everybody's mailbox behind a gated door that required a key for entry.&nbsp; Folks can't even have their own mail without getting robbed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I won't even mention the random drunks that used to piss and pass out in our hallways.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I digress.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   All I'm saying is these li'l youngins out here now think that shit is cool to choose that ghetto shit.&nbsp; I will say that I'm glad I came up in a 'hood cuz I woulda caught a lot of ass whuppins in the club&nbsp;by now..lol.&nbsp; And I know jump out when I see em.&nbsp; But I'll be dayumed if I'm gonna CHOOSE to live that way now.&nbsp; In my opinion, the YoungBloodz did the wrong.&nbsp; They glamourized being poor and thugged out.&nbsp; Dass what's wrong with these little minions now.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of them&nbsp;come from decent households.&nbsp; But they will find somebody hard be it an uncle or cousin who shot somebody or a classmate that has no fear.&nbsp; These little bastards CHOOSE the ghetto lifestyle like they ARE Fitty&nbsp;Cent or Li'l Flip.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dayum.&nbsp; What's next.&nbsp; R. Kelly gonna&nbsp;manage an Upward Bound program and ODB gon drive&nbsp;the bus?&nbsp;&nbsp; Kobe Bryant gon' star in Bring It On&nbsp;3?&nbsp; Shit's just upside down.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    urlLink DC and Maryland is off the chain now .&nbsp;  urlLink Da&nbsp;youngins done gone mad !!!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   That's just my observation on what I saw.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   **Random Thoughts**     &nbsp;   I wanna party with Nicole Richie - I love her man!     &nbsp;   TV One and the Apollo should get a divorce.&nbsp; If I see another Stephanie Mills circa 1989 with her ultra velvet mini skirt two piece on, I think I'll die.&nbsp; They lunch real hard on there.&nbsp; My question is: Did we actually think the acts back then were good?&nbsp; I know I watched that shit.&nbsp; Sinbad, Keith Sweat, Troop, Tevin Campbell and Yo Yo?&nbsp; We either had to be still awf da Jheri-Curls-make-me-feel-free mentality or we were some STRAIGHT BAMMAS!!!&nbsp; Two words: shoulder pads     &nbsp;   Finally I found one of  urlLink these  that didn't make me look four months pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;
