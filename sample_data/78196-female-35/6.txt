CONFESSIONS OF AN EBAY WHORE    Now I'm supposed to be finished with a project today but no, I can't stay off of EBay.  I must see who's selling what so I can buy.  I really like  urlLink this jacket , but I'm trying to convince myself that I don't need it.  It's going for 20 bux right now and I gots to have it.            My latest wins!  These bids didn't even total up to $50.00, imagine that?  Belt=12.99, jeans=16.00, patch=1.00, shirt=20.00.  I had to get the shirt for my "sister".  She loves loves loves Madonna and that shirt is coming from Hollywood.  I thought that would be cute.
