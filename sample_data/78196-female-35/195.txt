This Is What PMS Will Do To You    If my hands were like razors I sculp my pain in the clay I loved him all of my life And she stole him in just one day    He brushes over my love The color of happiness He sketches my broken emotions on canvas    I used to be the one that he loved  And he gave it all up for her Now the pieces of me are growing old I'm feeling older than the words of Picasso    Passion turning into pain His love for me somehow she changed Now im drawing in the rain Sketches of your face   Written by PRU
