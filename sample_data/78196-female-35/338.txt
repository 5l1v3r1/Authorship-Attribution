Straight Bakin'   Maaaaaaaaan it's hot as balls outside!  I spent the past three hours in that heat.  My ex-boss/technodwarf came to see me today so we hung out downtown.  I walked outside and lost five pounds!  (yeh right..not on your life biggums..lol).  We did Dupont Circle while watching the "boys" flaunt it topless at the fountain.  Then we tried to make it down to the Mall but um...Yall know how hot it is out dere?  We looked at the temperature on the bank clock and it read...104.  What da?  I know the "hospillah" is full of fools.  We went to a cafe, had us a iced mocha and came back to my crib and ..well...got plastered.  Oops I did it again.  Got effed up onna holiday.  Figures.  It's been way too long though.  I had a dry season.  Nuffin.  Just awf da cuff wit it.  So today is Independence Day....a day when we are supposed to be proud of our independence.  Weez free!  So im gon' do whatever I want.  So I got tore up.  Cupla shots and some Bud Light (scratchin my head).  Over here "raising our awareness" and sending smoke signals.    DC is packed!!!!  With tourists, gay people, and police.  I swear!  All the so-called regular folk are cookin out or chillin' at the pool.  Except one idiot wet some people up at LAX (da fuck was his problem?).   But yah, it's awf da cheese down here.  I ain't seen so many soccer moms in one place in my whole dayum life.  Attack of the strollers type shit.  I'm proud to be an American though.  Fuck it.  I'm proud to be here for real.  Lotta folks aren't.    I'm gonna watch the fireworks from Magenta's roof.  Her building has a nice setup up there.  So we're gonna get tore up (again) and watch the lightshow.  I can't stomach the Mall.  Too hot.  I felt like a human lightnin' bug out there.  Just roaming around mad cuz this hot ass light keep followin me.  If I feel like frying, maybe I'll stroll down there and people watch.  If not...it's naptime for my ass.
