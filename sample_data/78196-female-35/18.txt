urlLink I blame them!!!    But it wasn't the tornado itself that took me down.  It was the water and them cheap assed Payless mules I was sportin.  I should write their asses and tell them to put warning labels on their shoes.   "Attention: Since your ass is too cheap to buy real shoes, please exercise extreme caution when walking in water."    or  "If you are a big girl, walking in the rain, don't buy shit from us"
