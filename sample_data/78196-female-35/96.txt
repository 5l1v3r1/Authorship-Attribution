Today's Dedication     I have to dedicate today to Usher cuz I'm feeling him on his song, U Got It Bad.  Whew!  My chest gets tight just thinking about the  urlLink lyrics .  Mm mm mm  U got, u got it bad If you miss a day without your friend Your whole life's off track   That would be me.  I've got it BAD!!!!  This will be the first day in three weeks that I will not see my sweetie.  We won't see each other again until Friday or Saturday.  What am I gonna do?  I literally feel sick.  I love that girl man!  I need somebody to bitch slap me or something.  This is BAD!!!
