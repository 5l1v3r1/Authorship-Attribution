It's Oun Nah!    I've been thinkin'.  Although I don't really take this Internet monster that seriously, I'm sort of blown by the fact that someone replicated my shit.    Thanks to  urlLink Angelique ,  urlLink Andrea  and  urlLink Alissa , I got pissed!  At first I was like eff it, but then I said to myself, "Nona!  You be somebody!  Get up!  And hannel yo sheeeeeeyit!"    So I give you endlesscalamity.com.  Bought it yesterday.  Working on new content.  Thinking hard about this since some assfuck decided to pull some petty shit.    I didn't realize that many people read this thing, nor did I expect to get so much luv.  Thanks!  Now when I wanna chase pills with Grey Goose,   I'll NOT do it cuzza my folks..lol.    I'd like to send a special shout out to TRENTMJI.  When I got your IM, you were already gone.  I wanted to thank you for your message.  Very nice.  Thanks man.  Lemme link you up (holla).
