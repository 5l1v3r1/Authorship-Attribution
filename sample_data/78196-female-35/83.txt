CLARIFICATION    There were TWO protests in Washington during the weekend of Sept. 29-30th.  One was the Anti Capitalism Convergence Protest and one was the Anti-War Protest.  I participated in the Anti-War/Anti-Racism protest at Freedom Plaza heading towards the Capitol.  The ACC Protest began at the Washington Convention Center moving later towards the U.S. Capitol.  From what I've seen (from other personal web sites) was that there was violent activity during the ACC Protest. It got a little out of hand and the police had to use force.  It still pisses me off that the news only covered that one (much smaller) instead of covering the larger Anti-War/Anti-Racism protest.  So still I say...lies lies lies!!!
