Nothing New   My weekend was pretty uneventful.  Friday, I had a little "get together" at my house with two (unmentioned) friends..lol.  We sat there all night and got blasted...completely blasted while watching bright lights and shit..LOL.  Evermean and I went to see Monster's Ball.  THREE WORDS: Halle's Sex Scene!!   I was so shocked that I slid down in my seat with one hand over my mouth awf da, "Awww..Halle!!!"  She went extra hard on there.  The movie itself was average.  Her part was interesting, to say the least.  I spent Easter Sunday with my parents.  Dad was a little sick and mom's and I had a little pow wow.  Then I ate dinner and passed out.     I've decided to start the job search again.  Love the time spent with Evermean (24 hours a day), but don't like spending all her money.  Being a housewife can be fun, but the trade-off is feeling completely inadequate.  So I'm back on the bricks...looking for a job.  This time, I may reach stalker status if they don't call me back..LOL.     Had a doc's appt. last week.  I lost 15 pounds..LMAO..go figure.  I didn't even try.  What am I doing?  Nothing different, just starving myself to freakin' death.  When I'm blown, I can't eat.  But I still drink and party (plus smoke a pack a day), so I guess I'll win Miss Crackhead 2003 if I keep it up.  Evermean, Tini and I have been doing a lot of drinking.  It's worrying me.  Tini spent almost everyday last week drunk.  Evermean and I emptied a FEW bottles of hard liquor since this time last week. We get bored at night, cable sux, so we decide to get drunk and pass out..LOL.       I'm aight doe.  My posts slowed down a bit cuz I was away from home.  Now I'm back ...I'll prolly be up late tonight so maybe I'll think of something funny to tell yall.  We'll see..lol
