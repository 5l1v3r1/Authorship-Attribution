Dat New Shit   I'm starting to get a little bored with this blog.  So I've decided to add a new feature.  My childhood was pretty "to the left" and my teens/early twenties were even more disfunctional.  It's time for me to share some of my stories.  I give you,  The Late Night Flashbacks  (posted whenever I get the urge).  Be well, my friends.
