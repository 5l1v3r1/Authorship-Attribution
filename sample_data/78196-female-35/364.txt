Ms. Jones   Hi yall.  I know I know.  I've been really shady with blogging lately.  My 'real' life has consumed so much of my time and I'm sorry to whomever seems to care.    I wanted to tell yall something.  I've been working, still acting a fool (as per usual), and trying to connect with my black gay sisters.  So I'm part of an online community of "Berries" who chat, exchange opinion, etc.  There's a woman who has really made an impact on me.  I mean my mouth flew open when I saw that she'd put something I wrote on her web site.    If anyone knows me thru this blog, you know that I am extremely open and opinionated.  I'll say almost anything..lol.  My past ..my past!!!!  LMAO.  Anyway, I wanted to tell Ms. Soulitude78 of Cleveland, Ohio (WE LOVE YOU CLEVELAND!!!!!) thank you!  Thank you girl!  Thank you!     urlLink Check out her site .  She's the grand mistress of poetry.  Show her some luv  yall.  MWAH Ms. Soulitude!!!
