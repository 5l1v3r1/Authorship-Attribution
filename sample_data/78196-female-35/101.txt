Yahoo's Yoohoo - The Conspiracy   Okay I'm convinced that Yahoo Mail is out to get me.  I'm seriously convinced that Yahoo personally sends me  urlLink advertisements  and they're showing up everywhere.  Am I the only one who gets the  urlLink  Lose 10 Pounds  , the  I Don't Wanna Be a Fat Mom  and the  Don't Be a Turkey on Thanksgiving  ads?  I don't think so.  Erryday yall..erryday I have to stare at these  urlLink God-awful ads  about my weight.  Sometimes they ask me to fill out shit like how tall I am, how much I weigh and what's my social security number.  Those can't be the only ads Yahoo runs.  So I think they are out to get me.  They've profiled my big ass and they ain't happy with it so now they're torturing me with these Lose Weight Today ads.  Somebody please tell me I'm not the only one!   I could've sworn I saw one on my wireless cell internet Yahoo.  It flashed real quick but I know it said,  Slim Down Bigums , I just know it.  I mean I know I'm a little swole but this is mean Yahoo!   Down right mean.  And I 'oun 'ppreciate it neeva!
