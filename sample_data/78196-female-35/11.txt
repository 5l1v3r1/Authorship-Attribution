Somebody's blog had this  urlLink Name Analyzer  thingy on it.  So I decided to find out what my results would be.  358?  Should I play the numba?  Or is that like my special tag?  Who knows, I just thought it was cool.  The results are a trip.Except for that wanting to be concerned with the outter world.  NO I DON'T!  I really could give a rat's ass.  My inner world is enough to choke the life outta ya.
