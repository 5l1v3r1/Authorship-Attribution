Back to My Old House    I goofed.  Did something screwy with Movable Type's scripts and jacked up my new blog.  So, until I figure it out, I had to temporarily move back over here..lol.    MT isn't the most comprehensible application.  I made some changes to one of my cgi files and WHAM!  I'm screwed.  If any nice people (with GoDaddy hosting) would like to assist me, pls post.  So far, I haven't been able to figure it out.   Until then....ize heeya!!!
