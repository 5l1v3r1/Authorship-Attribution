The Storm Before the Calm    I'm up.  No.  It's really not insomnia.  IT'S FUCKING BEFORE I GO ON VACATION STRESS! I'm trying to meet a deadline (which is why I haven't blogged) and just finished this very minute.      Why is it that every time you go on a vacation, you get stressed the hell out at work?  For me, I don't trust anyone to do my job.  Vacation or not, my team still has deadlines.  And I have to take care of my part.  I swear I've been sitting in front of this computer since 7pm.  Now I'm just up feeling used.       I won't have any tolerance when I go in the office IN APPROXIMATELY 6 HOURS!!!  L'il Neck really don't wanna mess with me.  Please pray that we get along and that she won't piss me off.        A few things are on mind before I turn it in.  Some shit's bothering me.  Other shit I'm just thinking about...hell......    I heard somebody got a sitcom pilot going off of someone's blog.  Apparently, they need permission from the blog author first.  My thoughts.  THAT'S FUCKED UP!  People! Get your own ideas!  Tell your own stories!  Stop milking other people's content.  Now I see why folks like  urlLink Pink-Rage  and  urlLink Erica  of B-girl dot net have started member based blogs.  And  urlLink Andrea  with her "private blog"...(wink)  Wangsters and bammas force you to block 'em out and IP trace their asses.  I guess that's why Walmart got dem Monolo boots now..LMAO.  Bitin' bammas.    Trees are still coming down around here.  Not sure what was up with that, but somebody got straight smashed on the parkway this morning.  Damned tree just fell in the middle of traffic.      I want a bowl of Cheerios NOW!  The craving just hit me.  Won't go hard this late though.  I'll settle for a piece of candy.      Evermean and I are taking a road trip.  NY may be a landing spot for us.  We're sort of feeling that party scene.  Plus she has never been to the Village.  Oh boy.  LOL.      I love Beyonce, but her vocabulary is limited.  She sounds like a Stepford Wife of the Millenium.  Mama Knowles be windin her up before interviews and shit.  Awf da wind and speak Beyonce dolls and shit.  She's hot to death, but the golden child can't speak for shit.   I have no idea where that just came from....      Kim Catrall was NOT one of the worst dressed for the Emmy's.   urlLink That dress was hot !    Another black Miss America huh?  Good shit.  Congrats  urlLink Ms. Dunlap !     You ever see somebody in bed naked and thought of all types of ill shit to do to them?  They just look so peaceful and you just sitting there staring and thinking "bad things"...lmao.  It's funny though cuz you don't know whether to get freaky or give'em a hot foot.  Right now, I'm feeling the latter cuz all I can fantasize about right now is dem Cheerios.  But for real though, Evermean would kill me if I ignited them toes.  I wonder what would happen if I made Cheerio happy faces on her tits.  Then I could kill two birds with one stone..lmao.    That's it.  I need sleep.
