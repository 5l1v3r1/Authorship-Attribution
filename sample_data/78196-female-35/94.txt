They've Found the Needle!!!   In  urlLink HAYSTACK!  Apperently the white folks are getting angry at this new wave of gangsta white boy rappers.  Of course, not all but the  urlLink Village Voice has something to say  about how this is affecting their communities.  LOL!!!  I don't care what anyone says..talent is talent, no matter what race you are.  And truth be told, Haystack can blow Eminem, Bubba Sparks, and even some black rappers out of the water!   Tini and I have been listening to Haystack for almost a year now.  I found them on the hip hop undergroud circuit and was amazed by how they rap.  These fools are the bomb!  I have to keep it real.  And coming from my perspective (25% southern redneck/hick blood - yes I gots white cousins in trailer parks, mkay?), they keep it REAL..lmao!   A Car Fulla White Boys  has been part of my music library for a long time man and that song is so dayumed funny but true!!!  I bet if lots of people gave them a chance and paid attention to what they say, they'd be able to at least identify with what's being said.  Fuck what these  urlLink conservative folks are saying , keep yall shit gangsta Haystack!!! SOUFSIIIIIIIDE!!!!
