Today's Dedication   I'm going to dedicate today to  urlLink this man  and I'll tell you why.  I don't care what anybody says, Cuda looks like he can do some nasty stuff to you.  I was at the bar last night and a friend and I began talking about him.  I told him that I'd pretty much do anything to meet ol' Cuda baby (tipsy of course) and my friend had a great idea: Get a job being like the towel boys for basketball and get paid to wipe the sweat off of sexy Cuda.  I guess that would make me Cuda's Battledome Sweat Bitch.  Maybe I'll just settle for a t-shirt that reads, "Will work for Cuda", with a lightening bolt painted across my face.  Nice ring to it huh?
