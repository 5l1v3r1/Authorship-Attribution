Highly Disturbing   I read this on a message board.   go to http:\\www.astalavista.com there is a text file there somewhere that talks about forensic research on pc hardrives and how microsoft decieves people who press delete and think files are gone you should really look for it . i think it is named 'what microsoft does not want you to know. it talks about completely hidden folders that you will never see but if you know the direct path you can enter them. it also mentions that all your emails and every website you visit are stored in hidden files that can be retrieved by detectives or forensic investigators, besides when you delete a file they are still there until the pc need to use that space ever heard of the 'undelete' command in dos    Makes ya think, doesn't it?
