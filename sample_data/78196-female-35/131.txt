I feel absolutely horrible today.  Last night a friend of mine took me to dinner and once I got home, I feel asleep on a full stomach.  So now I feel like I have a brick in my belly and I got kicked in an alley by trick or treaters.  I feel like I got jumped or something.  It's even hard for me to hold my head up because the headache is unbearable.  The sad thing is, I didn't drink last night.  I think I just OD'd on food and my body has had enough.  I wasn't satisfied with the pizza joint the night before, I had to go out again and eat you guessed it....steak.  If yall know me, yall know that steak, I dont usually eat.  But because I went to a steak house, I got cute and figured why not?  So now I'm sitting here with sour stomach and a headache that won't quit.  Mad cow?  Nah...pissed off bitch, that would be me.  I hope nobody has a "beef" with me today because I wouldn't even be able to defend myself.  That's so sad.
