Today's Dedication      I've sat at home and watched Ms. Brit's HBO Elvis style ad over and over again, and every time I see it, I get breathless.  She's not one of my favorites, but I've got to give it to her.  She got her man on this one!  The  Slave 4 U  song is hot too and yeh...Brit did it this time.  No more bubblegum little sweet girl next door, mkay?  She got in my chest with this look.  I was listening to the song today and realized that yes...I must dedicate today to her for the lyrics:   (evil grin)    I'm a slave for you.  I cannot hold it;  I cannot control it.  I'm a slave for you.  I won't deny it;  I'm not trying to hide it.    I feel you guuh!!  Claude Hamercy...lol
