Invitation   This chick who's heads up an elist I'm part of actually sent out this email:   RENT PARTY THIS SATURDAY 3/30!   I am throwing an old school rent party to help raise part of my April Rent! I haven't found a roommate yet, so I need some additional funds! I will feed you, and provide entertainment. This is a private party, not associated with any groups that I am in, but I've invited almost everyone I know. Please come out and help out! Feel free to invite your friends, or bring them with you! I am asking for a donation of $5.00, but if you can give more, please do! My place is easy to reach from either 395 or 495. If you don't have directions already, email me at *********** and I will send them to you, or call ******** and if you don't get me directly, leave a message in my voicemail with a number where I can call you back.   Do yall see the humor in this?  A rent party?  Man I ain't heard of one of them since Florida and nem threw one for Weepin' Wanda.  Remember that?  That's the one where Wanda was doin the snap and her world-famous karate kick dance..LMAO.  Times is hard yall!  This goes down as my first [ever] rent party invitation.  Next there will be car note and grocery parties.  What kinda world is this?!!
