Today's Dedication     Let me tell yall about this young lady.  She is a trip!  I read her  urlLink blog  regularly (found it about a month or so ago), and I swear to beans she is my twin.  Mentally.  I think we're from the same planet.  When I say this girl is funny as hell, that's an understatement.  Girlfriend is wild!  A lot of what she says and how she says it is so how I think.  She has some shit on her mind, yall.  Whenever I'm having an evil day, I read her blog and literally LOL!  I can appreciate a sista with a lot of angst, but a funny way of explaining things.  Go Tiffani!!  Today's your day cuz you provoke thought and make me laugh at the same time.  I fux wiff you.  Here's to you Ms. Tiffany (hugs)   Note: Sorry I posted your pic without permission (don't kill me)...LOL.
