Love On the Highway   I fell in love on 95.  I did and it's so pathetic.    Evermean and I went back to Jersey last Friday to visit her grandmom.  She's doing much better, thank goodness.  Anyway, we're on 95 and I see this black Acura Legend drive by.  Not that the car made a difference.  The guy was so stinking cute.  So of course, I'm trying to sneak a peek without being noticed by either Evermean or the Mr. Black Acura.  First, I get nabbed by Evermean (and her smart comments).  She and her sisters were awf da jokes cuz my old ass done made goo goo eyes at somebody on the road.  The Acura dude caught me to.  Let me just say this.  I certainly did not fit the profile for this dude.  Me?  Big yella lezbo chick.  Him?  Dark, curly haired white guy, early forties, with the cutest dayumed dimples I've ever seen.  Had the sharp, chiseled jaw and beautiful teeth.  So I'm thinking I'll admire him from the winda and just keep on riding.  No.  Each time he caught up to the car, he shot me a grin.  Of course I was so embarrassed that I'd gotten caught flirting on the highway and shit.  He smiled and blushed while I'm saying to myself,  Oh no this white man not flirting back with me!... lol.  Evermean kept saying, "Let me catch up to your boyfriend"  Being all sarcastic and shit.  I didn't care, I thought he was as cute as he could be.  Still embarrassed I ride along hoping not to pass him again cuz I done got caught.   He gets over and goes into the Delaware House Rest Stop.  Evermean suggests that we follow him so I can get his number.  Yall know I chickened out.  What imma say?  "I rode beside you, and now I wanna RIDE ON YOU?"  Cmon!  I just laughed and let my little cutie Acura dude drive off.    I couldnt bear to follow him.  For all I know, he coulda been another  Todd   and that woulda been way too much.  [will explain later in a late night flashback].  Stay tuned.
