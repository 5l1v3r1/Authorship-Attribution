Annamaniac       Does anyone understand? I cannot stop my infatuation with her.  I'm sick over this woman and can't get enough!  Evermean, Mawny and I tune in to her show every faithfully and COULD NOT miss her holiday special.  That shit was funny!  When I say she acted like a complete maniac, I'm not lying.  This sounds so bad, but minus the millions, me and ol' Anna have at least one thing in common.  I'm serious.  She's a party animal. She knows how to throw 'em back and even pop a pill when she's not feeling the drama.  I UNDERSTAND ANNA!!  She's a big girl with a ridiculously beautiful face.  AND ... she just don't care.   Always awf da 'eff dat' status.  I love her!!!!     I know it sounds really bizarre, but I oun care.  Anna's hot!   A lot of people think she's just fat.  I think she's phat to def.   Anna gotta ass like a sista...lol.  But she's so misunderstood.    Back to her holiday special.  Please please tell me what the hell is wrong with her cousin Shelly?  We're sitting there laughing at drunk assed Anna.  When all of a sudden, Shelly starts singing Christmas carols with NO TEEF.  Then she started stripping and said, "I need I need to get laid real bad!"  Why did somebody yell, "I got five on it!"  Yall....when I say I stretched out in laughter like a two dolla crackhead I ain't lying.  That shit was hilarious.  Then anna tongue kissed Margaret Cho and that bitch said, "Oh I gotta go home and masturbate."  LMAO!!  How can I get on her guest list?   How?  I'll personally fly to Cali to party with Anna's ass.  No bullshit.  I can see it now.  Me and Anna.  Two swole up, drunken sex freaks who can wear the hell out of red lipstick.  But see... I'm disfunctional and love disfunctional drunks..lol.  Love them!  So Anna, Judy Tenuta, Ozzy...all yall...I gots love fo' ya babeh!  Shake dem haters off girl.  You can forever get it in my book.
