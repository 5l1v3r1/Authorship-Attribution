How She Do Dat?    I've only been to work for 20 minutes and already I feel violated.  First of all I don't work in a cube.  Worse.  I'm in a tech room.  Basically office HELL.  There are 12 of us in one big room.  No privacy.  No dividing walls.  Just a big open space.    I am one of only three Americans here and one of only two females.  Me and ol' Li'l Neck are the only ladies here (although I think she's a bird humpin alien).  We have seven Indians and two Asians, one of whom  started yesterday.  I've never had a problem working here and the guys are really cool because we talk a lot and share our differences, etc.    New dude is off his rocker.  When I came to work this morning, he walked up to my desk and just stared for like 30 seconds.  Then pointed to my hair and said, "How you do that?  Your hair.  How is that done?"  Why did everybody stop and stare like they've been wanting to ask me that for months?  Even Li'l Neck with her tight assed Peggy Hill, behind the ear swoopback hairdo was in my grill!  So kindly I said, "It's twisted by hand."   He goes, "Oohhh how long it take?"  I'm like, "Nine hours."  His eyes got so big and he said, "Why you not use  urlLink IGIA .  They have a machine that will do it for you."  Again, politely I say, "No.  IGIA wouldn't be able to do this."  THEN he says, "Can I touch it?"  FUCK NO YOU MORON!  I say, "No.  I don't like people touching me period."  Finally he backed off.  And my team went back to what the fuck they were doing cuz they saw that I was irritated.  So now new dude is staring at me, trying to examine my hair.  Like, "ooohhhh new African style."  Doesn't he see this is rude?  So now I'm just sitting here trying to think of reasons NOT to make an offensive comment to him.  Boy could I say a lot right now, but we're outnumbered so I digress.
