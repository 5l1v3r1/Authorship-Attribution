urlLink   urlLink   Addiction   I need help!  I need help now!  EBay is gonna cause me to go broke and get thrown out of my apartment!  The first sign of an addiction is denial.  Been there, done that.  So I'm guessing I'm worse off than I thought.  I dont know, but I can't stay away from EBay.  All day I bid, buy, bid, buy, search, click, bid and buy!  WHY???!!!!!!!   Shit like  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  and oh God,  urlLink This ! makes you addicted to ebay.  I'm a shopaholic by nature but I haven't been to the malls lately because ALL OF MY SHIT COMES FROM EBAY!!!  I feel like a prisoner in my own home because I'm don't have to leave to get good stuff.  Oh please call the authorities now!
