Today's Dedication     SO FRESH AND SO CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN!!!  Thanks Incubus for writing that  urlLink song ! You've made my day cuz I'm feeling that shit!  I've unleashed, let go, and told the truth to someone near and dear to my heart.  I've NEVER felt cleaner in my whole life.  The monkey that was on my back has been rebuked and sent on it's petty little way.  I hope he got the ride of his life, cuz he's not ever invited back.  FUCK YOU MONKEY!  FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU!!!  (exhale)
