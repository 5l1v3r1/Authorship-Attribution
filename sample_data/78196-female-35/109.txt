Big Shoulders Is Back!!   Just when I thought she was missing in action,  urlLink BIG SHOULDERS  resurfaces wearing a dark purple dress with puffy sleeves and lavender flowers all over it.  I guess she's all dressed up for Turkey Day huh?  She'll probably kneel and pray to the  urlLink Almighty Gobble God   giving thanks for her powerful bubonic shoulders and batwinged eyebrows.  Aw shucks, she also got a tune-up on her snatchback.  It's definitely high and tight, complete with moisture-sealed oil sheen.  She came over to say hello and deliberately said, "Hello gentlemen." (speaking to my techno-dwarves)  I knew the bitch wouldn't say shit to me so she said 'gentlemen' to be funny.  What if I went over to her dept. and greeted her team wiff a, "Hello folks with normal sized shoulders" or "Hi ladies without snatchbacks!"  How would she feel?  I hope she runs out of oil like Nipsey Russel on the Wiz, stuck under the tracks and cannot move.  Who would she really be though?  Nipsey or the fat bitch who smothered him?  I don't know.  It's a toss between her high-powered, magnetic shoulders and her high-lifted, boxed-out ass.  Can yall tell I can't stand this bitch?  At any rate, she should change her name to Natasha (ahSatan backwards).  She's definitely Satan's spawn.  Imma go over there and rebuke her snatchback!
