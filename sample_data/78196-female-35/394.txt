Congratulations Blk Castro!       I'd like to congratulate my brother on his big day.  Heez married nah!  lol  I also welcome, wholeheartedly, my new sister-in-law.  Welcome to the mayhem girl!!    The wedding was a blast as was the bachelor party (evil grin).  I'll post an update and possibly more pictures on at a later date.  But I need to mention the pimp cup.  lol!!!   Dude won't let it go yung.     See, I threw him is bachelor party.  Why you ask?  Because I know how to pull shit together like dat..dass why..lol.  Nah, I had this idea of having him go out like a sultan.  You know turned my apt. into a genie's tent with all the trimmings and hired three girls to be his personal servants.  He didn't have to lift a finger all night while his friends sat there pissed..lol.  One of the "gifts" that his "harem girls" gave him was a pimp goblet.  Yeh I got three harem girls to serve him all evening.  Lucky him.  Dass cuz he got a pimpalicious sister..lol.  Called in a few favors, hired a few strippers, and he had the time of his life.      It was all rated PG, trust me, I was there.  All in all I'm glad things went over well.  And I'm especially glad he finally married Tallulahbelle.  Good shit.
