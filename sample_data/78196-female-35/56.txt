Honorable Mention   Instead of dedicating today to one person, I've decided to give out honorable mention to a few folks:   urlLink  Max Antlers   - because a certain young lady I know was shaking her legs feverishly last night and raised up.  So I thought of you MAX cuz my self-esteem was awf da chain after that!!!       urlLink Lenny     - because your girlfriend is a broken-down sack of mule shit on Halloween.  How dare she insult and belittle you on national television.  He's kinda sexy and so sweet on TV   urlLink  Tracy   - because I usually have terrible mornings and thanks to her, I almost swiveled my big hog ass into the wall from laughing at her!  Tracy ROX!!!! (no hateration yall...she bout it bout it)   urlLink  Blu Cantrell   - one, because she's fine as all get out and two, because she wrote a song called "I'll Find a Way".  Listening to that song this morning stops me from violently attacking a man in Arlington (name not revealed), slashing his tires, breaking all his windows, busting his door down, fucking the hell out of him, and putting a pillow over his head.  That song is definitely therapy for me.  Thanks BLU!!!  (((hugs)))
