Much Love Fo' Da Sistas   I went back  urlLink home  tonight.  This used to be where I lived when I was closeted.  I was a regular member of the Sistas chatroom back in the day.  So I figured I'd go in and take a peep.  Man, I had a ball with those fools.  A few years ago I would spend everyday in there talking to friends with no faces.  That was until 80% of the room was populated by chix from the DC area.  Some of us met in person, one chick would throw chatroom parties and we all became pretty cool friends.  When I went in there tonight..no familiar names!  It sucked for a while but then I started acting a fool with the new crew in there.    So I wanna show some love.  Much love to my old Sistas from way back: Seven (my dizzawg!!!), Imajin, Total, QuietStorm, CocoaButta, Proximity (wink.lol), and my girl Saxxy.  They're now my in-person friends.  Now I've met some new folks.  Hugs go out to NaDaze,  urlLink CharmingSoftStud ,  urlLink Prettygirl25 , just3,  urlLink Saucy ,  urlLink Beautylicious ,  urlLink passionfruit10  with her crazy ass.  That's why I'm up this late.  Chattin with those fools.  BIG UPS TO MY OSO COALITION SISTAS..LMAO!!
