El Hombre   I want my country back!  I'm sick of this shit!  I want to wake up one day and know that all is good again and our gun-totin' president ain't trying to fight folks.  I'm mad I had on my gators today.  Why is it that we always wear messed up shoes during emergency situations?  When I got on my industry standard rubber-soled flats, don't shit happen!  As soon as I decide to push it in gators, here we go...a big girl gotta walk for blocks awf da sweaty feet.  AGGGH.  One good thing came out of this, I guess.  A construction dude named Miguel tried to pick me up..LOL How funny is that?  He's working on the building across the street from me and he lays cement.  AWWWW I done got holla'd at by a cement molder..LOL!!  He was fine doe.  All buffed and dirty (dass how I like 'em) wearing his little construction hat.  He's from South America and it's all good cuz I can speak ghetto Spanish..lol Lunch with Miguel should be funny.  What's gonna be extra interesting is when he finds out I gotta deranged "wife"..LMAO.
