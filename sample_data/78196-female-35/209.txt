Today's Dedication - Ms. Congeniality   I'd like to dedicate today to Ash and her crew.  Thank you so much for making this little blog a bit more popular.  Thank you for allowing my fans to express themselves.  One thing.  It's all love in my blog community.  Get it?  ALL LOVE.  You might wanna G up your Daisy Chain Mafia just in case I'm feeling a little saucy.  Thanks again ash.  Here's to you, pumpkin!   Disclaimer: Although my daily dedications are typically for persons who inspire me or impact my life, I chose to give Ms. Ash a WHOLE DAY to think about how this shit started.  Back to business tomorrow.  Thanks.
