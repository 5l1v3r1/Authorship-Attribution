Post VDay   My V-Day wasn't all that bad.  Saw Evermean after she got off work (at 2am).  The poor thing was so tired and frustrated due to a cupla fools she had to lock up.  All I could do was let her go to sleep (wiff her sweet lil self).  She takes such good care of me ALL DEE TIME, so I wasn't bitter about her being so worn out.  We spent yesterday together which was good enough for me.   Today I have my 3 nephews,  urlLink Niko ,  urlLink Shawn , and  urlLink Amir .  It's not even 7:00 and I'm worn out!  We went out to eat and now they're watching movies.  Of course they hit da pockets!  I love my li'l babies so it's all good.  I couldn't get Tayah this weekend cuz that would be too much, plus I had her last weekend.  My nephews love my web cam so all afternoon they were doing they're versions of Li'l Bow Wow poses.  So funny.  All I wanna know is who's responsible for the fake gang signs?!!  Is it their parents or music videos?  I don't know but my siblings need a "talking to" cuz I'm not feeling the ghetto-thugness..lol.  On a good note, all three of them are on honor roll.  Amir is learning to write his alphabet in Arabic as well as speak it.  It's so cute seeing him mumble in another language (and he's only 4).  But I'm so stinking tired already.  I don't think I'm ready for chirren (sigh).  This is major work!  The Grinch, Pokemon, and Spy Kids will be my babysitters for the next couple of hours.  Movies rock when grown folks need a minute.  I definitely do.
