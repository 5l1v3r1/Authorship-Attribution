Happy Birthday Teo!!!   Today's my  urlLink sister's  birthday.  The big 23 (I should smack her li'l yung ass). She would be my little sister, who doubles as Mini Me.  Why?  Because I taught her on how to party.  I think I created an animal!!! A-NEE-MAL.  Truthfully, she has the party gene (just like me), but I think she done ran wiff da jont.  She's awfdafence...LOL  That savage will party with the best of them and make friends urrytime.  Thanks to big sister Nona, she's building the same reputation as me...THE LAST MOTHERFUCKER STANDING!  (woo hoo).  Love you Teo...I swear I do.
