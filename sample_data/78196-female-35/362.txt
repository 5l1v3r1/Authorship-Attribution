A Drunk Serving Drunks   My weekend was very interesting.  Friday, I figured I'd go to the club I had to bartend at.  That way I could feel the vibe from an employees perspective instead of a club-goer.  Usually when I've gone there, I've been so shitfaced that I didn't even know my name.  Either that or dancing like a deranged fool.  Well, it I went, I saw, and I tried..lol  First of all, me and lil sis got TORRREEEEE UP before we got there and then one of my bartender buddies got us drizzunk!  So I go into full bastard mode and start acting up.  This BIG BIG BIG chick was trying so hard to holla.   I gave her a BIG BIG BIG, "I'm taken" and stepped off (without falling on the floor)  Our shit was crunk!  It was so bad, my sister couldn't even make it out of the car afterwards.  So me and her random "FedEx delivery stud" friend helped get her propped up so she could ride with the seat belt on.  Poor lil sis.  And big sis wasnt no help cuz I was two sheets to the wind baby!  Now this is a club I've frequented since the beginning of the 6 years I've been SGL (Same Gender Loving)..oh so politically correct.  lol.  A girls club in DC which will remain unnamed (wink wink).  It used to be known for it's major party atmosphere but now it's only poppin on certain nites.  Friday nite wasn't it.  Saturday when I had to work, it was aight.  I'll never hang out with Kreg an Nem and work behind a bar again!    Anyway, my first day was cool.  The dom girls were trying yall..lol.  But I am the queen of the bullshitters.  If you keep tippin' I'mma keep tellin' ya what you wanna hear..LMAO.  Did pretty well.   No problem children or psycho chix.  Lot's of pretty girls..wow!  I think I'm going to really enjoy this gig.  I can't wait to see how it's gonna be this Summer.  That shit will be funny.   Other than that, I chilled all weekend.  Evermean and I had a little QT so it was all good.
