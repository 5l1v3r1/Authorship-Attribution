urlLink  RUFUS REUNITES WITH CHAKA KHAN      Awww shucks.  She's back with her band.  Man they used to be so funky. I remember "What Cha Gonna Do For Me" video when Ms. Khan was fierce baby!  I should've known I was gonna be into chicks because of how I was so mezmerized by her presence on TV.  I remember being around 10 or 11 years old, looking at entertainers thinking, "I wish I had a body like that." when I should've known that was my mind's way of denying my chick fetish..lol  Now I look back on the artists that I used to "like" (Sade, Sieda Garrett, Chaka Khan, Cindy from En Vogue, Pebbles, Janet), and think, "dat was some gay shit man".  LOL  Now when I see the newer ladies (Keisha from Total, DaBrat, Janet, Rosie..the old video chick wiff da braids, Pamela Anderson..dont ask me why, and Trina) I know I'm pro-booty like a mug!!  LOL
