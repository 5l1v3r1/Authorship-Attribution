Why?         It's about time an influental hip hop artist had something GOOD to say. Jadakiss got his man by writing a song like  Why . His messages towards the powers that be and today's state of affairs is some aight shit. Especially his direct message to  urlLink Satan's son-in-law . Some would say he's the offspring of  urlLink Dr. Evil  and the  urlLink Quaker Oats man in drag . But I digress.       I watched Jada's video and it made me think. Have we ever asked ourselves why? Like flat out? WHYYY?      I have:      Why do some mothers choose their boyfriends over their kids? You'd be surprised how many young people just want love and attention.

Why are gold/platinum fronts still en vogue?    Why are mosquito bites time released? Dem bitches don't itch until 2-3 days later.       Why did Evermean and I go out on Saturday and got plastered? Doing our usual. Seeing nakedness. Just us two assholes lookin' at ass. She done fell in love with   urlLink  her   . WOW. You have to see her in person. And she's nice too. LOL.      Why are there so many DL brothers in DC? It's fine if you're bi, but stop lying to your wives and girlfriends. HIV and AIDS is awf da chain 'roun hur. Stop dat bullshit!  Why am I still spotting females with bad weaves? Git wit technology or just be yourself. Stop using glue for your tracks!
