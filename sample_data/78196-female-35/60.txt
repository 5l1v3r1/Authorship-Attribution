Papi Falso    For the n*gga who be talkin loud and holdin his dick talkin shit,  HEEEEE BETTER LAY LOW    This goes out to my main man Miguel...papi chulo?  Si, pero papi falso definitivamente!  Okay how bout at lunch just now, Miguel had the nerve to be posted up on the corner as if I was gonna come over and get all moony with him.  Dat fool don't know me, eff dat!  To make matters worse, he had his homies watching him thru the constuction site fence.  Now see, if you gonna blow your own shit up for your boys, you need to get carried!  So I just pranced right by him giving a shady, "howudoin?" and kept on marchin baby.  I can't stand  urlLink "hot"  fools like dat!  UGH!!  He was aight until he started being a bamma 'bout shit.  This time Mr. Migues didn't have on his hard hat.  Still a cutie pie with a tight body, no doubt, but um...nah shawteh.  He lost major points by going out like  urlLink that  on the corner for his boys.  He obviously don't know what he fuckin wit!  That's the funny part.  Dat fool don't know me man.  He don't realize that I'm a shepimp from  urlLink C.O. City  and I block shots on da daily.
