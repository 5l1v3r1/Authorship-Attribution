Back To A Normal Life   Now that I've told my Savannah stories, it's back to business.  I had a great birthday.  Evermean, Tini, and Magenta took me out to dinner at Marrakesh (7 course meal).  That was a blast.  Evermean bought me a beautiful white gold necklace.  One of my closest friends had over 100 girls sing Happy Birthday to me over the phone from Chicago (before the fashion show)..lol    Last night, I cried like a somebitch when Halle Berry won that Oscar.  CONGRATULATIONS HALLE!!!  I cried worse than I did when Swan won!  Me and Evermean sat there crying while her sister was looking at us like, "yall suck.  crying is so not cool."  LOL  She's 17...(figures).  Sidney Potier almost got me, but Halle had me awf da Cowardly Lion cry.    Other than that, I've been chillin'.  Pretty much a housewife.  Right now, I'm babysitting Evermean's sisters for Spring Break.  They are so cute..lol.
