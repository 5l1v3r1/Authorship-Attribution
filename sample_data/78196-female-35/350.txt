Mighty Kitty   My roommate has done loss her mind!  Yall know I'm temporarily living with Evermean right?  Well, I have a cat back home.  Shayde.  He's fat, spoiled, attention starved, but HE'S A LIVING BEING!!  Tini has taken over as his mother until I return home.  She'll eventually adopt him, but I aint signing the papers after what happened this morning.  Whyyyyyyyyy did she forget to get him cat food last night and due to the effed up weather, she didn't have time to run and score him a box.  Okay, Shayde is starving.  She told me that she went upstairs to borrow a can of tuna from the neighbors.  They didn't have any.  So they gave her a can of Turkey and Rice ...MIGHTY DOG!  She gave my cat Mighty Dog.  MIGHTY DOG??!!!! So of course I didn't know this shit had taken place today so she Instant Messaged me: "Nona...Shayde is a mighty cat!"  I'm thinking she's awf da jokes, getting ready to give Shayde a good progress report or some shit.  Maybe he made momma proud.  NO.  She told me this story and I couldn't believe it.  I couldn't get mad at her though.  She said at first he looked at her like she was trippin, then he dove in.   It was munchtime for mighty cat.  THAT SHIT IS FOUL.  So tomorrow, I'm going to PetSmart to land Shayde an industrial sized bag of cat food.  Enough for a whole family of cats.  I feel like falling to my knees in front of him, like Scarlet O'Hara screaming, "AS GOD AS MY WITNESS!  HE'LL NEVA GO HUNGRY AGAIN!!!"  This can't happen again.  Imma choke the life outta Tini man.
