Today's Dedication     I'm dedicating today to Starvin' Marvin cuz a bitch ain't have shit to eat today but a forkfull of spaghetti.  And that was at 8:30 this morning, before I left Evermean's house.  So I'm sitting here awf da low blood sugar, throat dry, and sharp assed hunger cramps cuz all I had to eat wuzza forkfull.  Dammit all to hell!
