View From the Top    &nbsp;   I took Evermean with me to South Beach last weekend.&nbsp; She'd never been and I had to witness her experience seeing the beautiful people down there.&nbsp; I swear to beans.&nbsp; Everybody in South Beach is hot in their own way.&nbsp; And I will never get tired of looking.&nbsp; Evermean, of course, had the time of her life.&nbsp; It was so good to see my lil pumkin happy and we had a nice assed hotel suite:   &nbsp;     &nbsp;   We had a nice view of Star Island and Biscayne Bay.&nbsp; Plus it was like 5 minutes from South Beach which was no problem at all.&nbsp; So we had a ball to say the least.&nbsp; But guess what?  &nbsp;  We got tore up down there!! OMG.&nbsp; Wet Willies murdered us in less than 4 hours!&nbsp;  &nbsp;      &nbsp;   Warning: Don't drink more than two  Call-A-Cabs. &nbsp;&nbsp; Wet Willie cancelled our evening.&nbsp; We just knew we were gonna party till daylight.&nbsp; Aw hells naw.&nbsp; We wanna roll wit da Everclear slurpees..lol.&nbsp; We had to carry it oun in before we made complete assholes of ourselves.&nbsp; Bad enough Evermean could barely stay up on the curb and I was a slobbering idiot.&nbsp; We got back to the hotel and instantly passed out.&nbsp; That's the second dayumed time I passed out in South Beach.&nbsp; AND I ONLY BEEN THERE TWICE!!&nbsp; LOL&nbsp; Lawd lawd lawd.  &nbsp;  The cab driver tried to convince us to go to this club called Space but we couldn't hang.&nbsp; So he goes, "You can go!&nbsp; They close at 12 noon!"&nbsp; THE NEXT DAY??!&nbsp; What kinda masochistic party animal does he think I am?&nbsp; We passed on that one.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We'll be back in two weeks.&nbsp; Willie....we comin' ta getcha!!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  LMAO  &nbsp;
