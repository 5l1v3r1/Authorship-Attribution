Oh The Humanity!   I just found out how much I'm worth:  $1,532,716.00 .  According to  urlLink humanforsale.com , that's my retail value.  I wonder how much my street value is?  Prolly 'bout $2,500.  That's $1,000 for my attitude, $1,000 for my sense of humor, $250.00 for my junk in the trunk, and $350.00 for my intelligence.  LOL  Lemme take my expensive ass to sleep.  I'm obviously tired.
