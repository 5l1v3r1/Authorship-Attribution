Domestic Silence  Wow.  This is crazy.  I haven't blogged in so long and still, folks are visiting on the daily.  Thanks urrybody!  Anyway, here explains my silence - I'M BUSY.  Any questions?  Nah for real though, I've been sort of all over, doing a lot of different shit.  Most of the time I'm with The Mrs - Evermean Martini.  How bout I moved in with her sort of.  Tini has had it with my not being at home (still live there) cuz I'm always over Evermean's.  The end of my Summer was cool.  The DC sniper had me lunchin for a minute.  Other "international bidness" got me feeling a little uncomfortable.  Yall know how it is.  Things are just strange lately.  In the past 3 months this was what I been up to:  Went to the Bahamas for a week in October Grew my hair out Still partying like a 20 year old A fight broke out at one of my house parties (myself included) - just plain wrong!   Tini and I prolly will sue our landlord - that should be fun Did a fashion show a few weeks back  Evermean's grandma had heart surgery - she's fine now! A childhood friend got shot and killed in front of my folks' house My brother got carjacked at gunpoint  Tayah turned 3 on Halloween - and she's too dayum grown!  My other nephews bdays rolled around as well Evermean's best friend moved in with us - I'll call her Mawny My boss told me I could telecommute indefinitely - woo hoo! I'm working at home - been doing it since Sept. So..  I'm hooked on cable and....  I done fell in love with  urlLink Trina.   Dats wussup.  I'll holla at yall.
