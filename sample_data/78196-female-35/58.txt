LEON LEON!!!     Talk about the chick that time forgot?  I don't know but for some reason I thought of her yesterday evening.  She just popped into my head all of a sudden.  I wonder where she is or what's she's up to.  I found out that she's from DC and turned 50 this year.  I don't care how much bad press she got, she will always be a diva in my eyes.    She taught me to never trust a man named Leon, that's for sure.  Even though I have a sickening crush on  urlLink him .  He can definitely "git it"...lol.  Yall can't tell me he aint hot!  I'm going to dedicate today to LEON.
