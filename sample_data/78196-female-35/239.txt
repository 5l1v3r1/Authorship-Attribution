Kee Kee and the kuh-NIH-fee(knife)   Evermean told me today that she heard on the radio that  urlLink Ke Ke Wyatt  (yall 'memba me mentionin' her) stabbed her husband in the back on Christmas.  That's bad.  What would someone do to make a person so mad, they'd stab them in the back, no less, on Christmas?  But it gets better.  She actually broke the knife off in his back.  Imagine that?  "You betta step off before I break diss blade off in yo ass!"  That requires meds.  Definitely, Ke Ke, meds girl.  I can't believe she did that.  Crime of passion?  Nah, fuck that!  That's a crime of pain.  That fool done got caught up in somebody else's ass or fucking with her money.  That's the only reason I'm seeing a woman stabbing a man, IN THE BACK.  I certainly hope this is a rumor, because she sings her ass off.  If it is, run Ke Ke, RUN!
