Black Widow   That's what I am.     How bout she just left?  Yeh, she spent over two hours telling me how she's grown so much and learned so much since we've broken up.  That's great, pumpkin (sigh), but I just want us to be civil with each other, no drama...PLEASE!!! Didn't work out that way.  Now I'm sitting here trying to process what just happened.  A Nona bashing session. Perfect.  Another ex-lover that has been tainted and ruined by the evil web I weave.  Another ex-lover who has found enlightenment after being with me.  Wonderful.  Not only that, she's in a "different place" right now trying to pick up the pieces.  WHAT FUCKING PIECES??!!  I'm puzzled.  Glad it's over.  I wanted to be "friends", but in the real world, that shit doesn't exist.  You don't fuck your friends.  That's why they are called FRIENDS.  Your ex-lovers just become  WEIRD ACQUAINTANCES .
