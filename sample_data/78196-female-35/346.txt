Congrats Lil Sis!!      Congratulations to my little sister, Keisha (aka Righteous) for being featured as the beauty of the week on VibeDC's web site.  She's branching out doing calendars in addition to her usual rap gigs.  By the way, much love to Fluid Ounces of DC for letting her spit last week.  Special thanks goes out to Sass for putting the word out.
