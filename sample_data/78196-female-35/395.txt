Someone Should've Told Me    Evermean and I went on a date to have seafood and QT.  We ended up getting a waitress who was "family" (much love to you Jay!!) and fucking crazy.    She asked us if we wanted to do a round of shots with her.  Yeh she was on the clock..lol.   So Evermean and I didn't have anything else to say but ... YES.    Long story short, this chick brought us double shots of 151.    After taking the shot, I felt a flame go down my throat!  Not even five minutes later, all three of us were butt-fucking drunk!    Never in my whole life have I drank anything (yall know I can drink) so strong.  I've done shots of burboun, tequila, Everclear, whiskey and never tasted anything like 151.   In the past, I really had no reason to take a straight shot of that shit.  My friends don't drink it.  No one I know has ever even mentioned it.    Hell.  I thought the Incredible Hulk (Hypnotic -n- Hennessy) will put you on your ass.  That's nothing compared to the one five one!  Man!!!  I will tell you this.  Never again son!  lol
