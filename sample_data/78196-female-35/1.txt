Something went terribly wrong late last night.  I was only taken to the  urlLink GATE  once and could not return.  Did I not have a key?  Did they change my access number?  Why was it that everytime I thought I was going in the right direction, I ended up at a dead end?  Seemed like I got dropped off and left with nothing to show me the way.  If only I'd left popcorn behind the first time I went.  Oh my!  The first time at the GATE last night was amazing.  I wanted to stay forever, but was asked to leave by the head of the  urlLink Turtle  Department.  My dismissal was a direct result of my behavior the past few weeks.  Turns out the rest of the departments did not appreciate how I handled my time.  I didn't get enough sleep in and I didn't follow through on what I promised.  To rest and not stress.  My penalty was one entrance to the GATE and I don't ever want that to happen again.  I wonder if I can file a complaint against the Turtle Department.  Tell them I was treated unfairly and that just because I didn't rest should not mean restricted access!  Not fair at all.
