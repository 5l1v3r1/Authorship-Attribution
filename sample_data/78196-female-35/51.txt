Somebody's Bitch      "Nowadays a G like me can't even call it A 25-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic"    I have to admit, that would be me in the dress.  The above lyric would be my sweetie..lol.  I got took like a 2 dolla crack slut last night.  Yall don't feel me doe.  I tried to hold on, but I regret to report that I was taken down like an old assed Stan Smith billboard.  "Officer Evermean" had some ill shit on her mind.  It don't make no sense that somebody could put my lights out.  I don't even remember hittin' da canvas, I just woke up this morning and I couldn't feel my legs and I ain't know where I was.  She obviously thought it was funny, especially from the (i tore dat azz up) smirk on her face.  It's OUN!!!!  Next time imma skeet in her eye..LMAO!!!     Imma go head and stop faking.  I'm happy as a hoodrat rollin' on dubs.  So go head my little po po mami, gloat baby!
