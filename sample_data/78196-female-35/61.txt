Religion is a Fallacy   And here's why... These are results from a  urlLink belief test  I took:      So that means based on what I truly believe, I'm a Jew? But I also fit the profile for Muslim?  This prooves that religion is a form of conditioning brought forth by MAN.  Yes!  Human freaking beings!  One God, One Soul, One Sacrifice.  That's what I believe in.  To heck with this religion stuff.  Kinda makes you look at extremism a different way huh?  Take the test yourself and see.
