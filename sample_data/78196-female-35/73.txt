Bad Magick     Does it feel so bad when you're taking a drag and when  you're looking at the world with dying eyes? When you stare at it dead and you're giving it head and all those things you say you love never come alive.    If it feels so bad, Bad magick playing off of me. Oh no, I don't wanna be your friend. Bad magick laying into me. Oh no, I don't wanna hear it again.   When you get so high that you're wanting to dye but everything around you is turning green. When you're getting so low and I know you've been feeling like a dried out leaf in a summer breeze. I don't like it!     Getting back, Back on track, Get off of my back     Basically how I'm feeling right now.  Thanks  urlLink Godsmack .
