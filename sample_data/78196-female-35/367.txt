Come Back Claude!!!!   I heard from an old dear friend today.  Claude Hamercy.  For those of you who don't know, he's my former boss/friend/partner in crime/smoke out partner.  I miss that dude man.  You talkin' bout FUNNY?  He is a nut.    I wanted to take this opportunity to say, "I miss you muhfukka! When you comin' back down my way?"   I remember back in the day when me and Big Reds took him to see the strippers.  We thought this dude was gonna be all scared and uncomfortable.  Pretty much...I thought I'd have to babysit himt he whole day.  HELL NAW.  Fool was the center of attention man and the shit was funny.  Are you still in love with Co Co Claude?
