Santa?  Satan?  Hello?   I fucking hate Santa Claus.  Everything about his fat ass, I hate.  I hate the fake assed furry trim around his dome.  I hate that gay assed pimp coat he wears.  I hate that fact that he chose the most innocent looking animals to pull his fat ass around. I hate that we tell our children he sees everything we do (wouldn't that be like God?)  I hate his image -good tidings my ass fucking Satan oops...Santa!  I hate that he takes up so much space at the mall.  I hate his pictures invade my personal space.  I hate that some of my family members stay away from me during Christmas..(cuz I'll tell their kids the truth..lol)  Santa Claus?  Who thought of this dumb shit?  Folks are homeless and dying of starvation, but we'll spend money on milk and cookies that we'll never eat.  Food wasted!  Why?  Cuz we gotta cover up those LIES so our kids wont know the truth about that fat bastard.   He doesn't exist KIDS!!  (yeh i said it).      urlLink I'm glad somebody feel me on this one .  And to think, I didn't like squirrels and now I have one who brought truth to the world.  That's funny.
