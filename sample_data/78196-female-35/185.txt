Microwave Madness - The Big Shoulders Brigade    urlLink Big Shoulders  has been missing in action and just as I was about to get worried, she resurfaces.  First of all,  urlLink Big Shoulders  has a new hairdo!  She got a snatch-back tuneup!  Let's call it  Snatchback 2002 - The Millinneum Edition .  I'm glad to know she's been  urlLink taking good care of it .  Her neck looks much neater and she got a new pair of focals.  Rock on Big Shoulders...ya bitch!!!  Anyway here at work, we have an old microwave in our kitchen that went bad so  urlLink Big Shoulders  sent her troops out to collect money for the new and improved microwave they planned to buy.  Considering the fact that me and my techno dwarves rarely use the microwave, all of us declined to pay up.  Let me go back a little.  Big Shoulders sent a group of three Shoulder Soldiers over to our area to collect the money.  They were all standing there and the one in the middle (I'll call her Private Pearl), was waving the collection envelope with this  yall betta pay up  smirk on her face.  But like I said, we decided that since we didn't use the stupid microwave, we weren't gonna pay the whopping two dollars.
