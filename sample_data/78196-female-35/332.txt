Yall Not Gonna Believe This   This is some made for TV movie type shit.  Sunshine, our new roommate is awf da cheese!  Things had been perfect with her for the past month..almost.  We've partied together, had dinner together, had heartfelt chats late at night.  She's met our "party crews" ... errything.  Then came rent time.  She disappeared yall.  Left all her belongings and we aint heard from her.  Of course Tini and I grew grey hairs trying to pay the rent and look for her ass.  After not seeing her for 5 days, we called her mom back in NC in case it was another Chandra Levy situation.  Basically in case somebody snatched her little ass.  Her mom was appalled and terribly embarrassed to find out about her behavior.  See, Sunshine is your typical little rich girl who's parents gave her everything.  A little country chick who's never been exposed to city living or even diversity on this level.  The number of bars alone is enough to send anyone's child into reckless behavior, you know?     We later found out a few things.  Because we hadn't heard from her in so many days, we needed to go in her room to find phone numbers, etc.  To our surprise, we found a fresh bottle of Ritalin.  Oh Jesus!  So basically we're dealing with a no-show with A.D.D.   I can't even go into the details yet.  All imma say is she is a really cool chick.  Had lots of fun in the past month.  But I swear to beans!  If she dont show up...CURTAINS!
