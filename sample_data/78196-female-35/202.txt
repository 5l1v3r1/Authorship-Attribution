Virtual Infusion   I've been thinking about how we meander online.  Day after day, we look for new shit to see or talk about.  One thing we never consider.  Who we interact with.  Who we laugh with.  Who we really give a fuck about.  We just do.  Just like that.  Practically anyone new, seemingly cool, with an edge or funny lifestyle, we bond with.  We roll with.  We chill with.  ONLINE.  No faces, just pictures.  No voices, just text.  ONLINE.  That blows my mind.  If we had the same optomistic and momentous behavior on the streets, that would be interesting.  If I can go to the club with that same flair and attitude (like I have ONLINE), would I have more fun?  If I gave the chick at the "counter" a chance to be my friend (like I do ONLINE) just one time, what would happen?  How bout if I treated my sisters as well as I treat my "online sustuhs"?  Makes me think, man.  There's something about this box I'm sitting in front of.  It makes me open my mind and heart.  I'm even my "real self" ONLINE. Not that monster I am on the streets.  That's extra funny.  I hate my monster suit cuz it's rul tight and I can't breeve.  Anybody want it?  Imma size BIG.
