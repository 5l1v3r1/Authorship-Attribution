THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM SUX    Arlington County sucks butthole.  My sister got sentenced to 48 hours in the Arl. Co. Det. Ctr. because she (as a bartender) failed to ID a minor and got nabbed by the ABC.  I understand the violation and even the punishment.  What I don't understand is why she was treated like she had just robbed a 7-11 last night.  From the bailiff to the judge, they were all assholes towards her and then my dumb ass (not knowing), attempts to approach my sister just to give me a hug and the fucking bailiff snatched me back like my name was Mohammed Atta or some shit.  Is this how one is treated when committing a harmless crime like serving failing to ID a minor?  FUCK!  I could give a rat's ass about these little dipshits who insist upon drinking.  If anything they're happy to take a sip or two.  What pisses me off is these I-have-no-fucking-life type ABC agents who are probably closet pedofiles or some shit.  They get off on busting bartenders at the peak of happy hour knowing good and damned well the place is busy.  I say fuck all ABC agents and the con artists/judges they roll with BIYAAATCH!!
