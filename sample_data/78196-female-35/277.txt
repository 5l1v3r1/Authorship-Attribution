Today's Dedication     Enigma is awf da chain!  Where have I been?  Bunned up with Evermean while listening to Enigma's  music.  I can't even begin to tell you what type of affect it has on a couple.  Let's just say, it's really interesting to listen to.  With that said, I'm dedicating today to them.  I had no idea they could put it down like that.  Yall should check 'em out and listen to a few  urlLink samples  of their tracks.  Now, Evermean and I can't see living without it.   LOL.  REEEEE-LAXING.
