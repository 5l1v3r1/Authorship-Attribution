I Wish Yall Could See Me    I pulled a muscle in my side.  It hurts.  Bad.  I went to work today feeling perfectly okay, but I sat all day so I guess I didn't realize I'd done something to myself.  Last night.  Evermean and I.  Well.  LOL  DAMMIT YOU HEARD ME!  I PULLED A MUSCLE IN MY SIDE!    I've pulled muscles in other areas of my body, but never have I done this.  This shit is way painful.  I feel like the "crooked letter" in Mississippi.  I can't even inhale deeply without doubling over in pain.  I figured eff the Tylenol, I'mma cruise on Univestin!  Yeh.  They should make me feel gooooooood!   If not, I think I'll just slam my forehead against the corner of a wall so that pain will be so intense, it'll take my mind off my side.  I feel like Baby Dee punched me in the ribs and kicked me with a pair of fresh Timbs afterwards.   urlLink UNIVESTIN ,  urlLink CONNECT PILLS , KREG!  HERE I COME DAMMIT!  I'm way annoyed today as well.  This fucking worm virus is blowing the bloody hell out of me!  I've tried all I can to spam block this shit but it isn't helping much.  The sobig.F virus done got everybody I know (except me) cuz I'm not dumb enough to open random attachments.  FUCK!    Sometimes I'm so bored at work, I be pressed for an email.  And I get one of those bullshit "Thank You" emails from some ballkisser from who knows where!  GRRRRRRRRRR!!!
