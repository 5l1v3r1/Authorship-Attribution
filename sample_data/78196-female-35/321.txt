Plug-In/Plug-Out   I realize that I'm slowly killing myself.  Long story short.  Glade Plug-Ins are highly toxic!  Evermean has a two bedroom pad.  And yall know I'm still here with her...my ass aint gone home yet.  Anyway, she has like 8 Glade oil plug ins all over the place.  For the past two weeks, I've had headaches, nausea, sore throat, and shortness of breath.  Couldn't really figure it out.  Thought it was a combination of chain smoking and PMS.  So I go home for a few days (after spending time in hell...Philly..will explain later), and I start to feel better.  Came back to Evermean's pad last Sunday.  Sick again.  So I took the paranoid route.  I'M BREEVIN TOXINS!  First, I unplugged the ones that were near the couch and bed.  Cuz errytime I take a nap, I wake up feeling awful.  Then I looked around on the Internet and to my surprise...GLADE OIL PLUG INS ARE EVIL.  I read all types of shit about them.   How they trigger asthma.  How they cause nausea and headaches (cuz the oil droplets are basically inhaled).  And they kill birds.  I'm like WHAT DA??!  So now, not only am I a housewife.  But now, I'm a victim of Glade.   A bitch done inhaled too much Glade Oil.  These piercing headaches and daily nausea gots to stop!  So I have to break the news to "the wife" that her fresheners are killing me.   MM MM MM
