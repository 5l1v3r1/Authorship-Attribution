Roommate Abuse   Last night Tini went to the bar with Magenta and came back home completely shitfaced.  I'm sitting in my room, watching TV, minding my own business when she comes in pissy drunk and tackles me down on the bed.  At first I thought she was playing, but later realized she was too drunk to even know herself.  The pressure's on!  I got away from her, ran into the other room and locked the door.  She was going nuts hollerin', "I'll gitcha!  I'll gitcha!" in a witchypoo like voice.  After she calmed the fuck down, we ended up in here listening to music all night.  Had a blast until Tini started snoring and slobbing on herself.  That was way funny.  As for me, I celebrated my anniversary sumpthin fierce...lol
