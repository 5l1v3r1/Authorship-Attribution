SAVE SWEETIE!!!       I was up early this morning like at 5:30 am (cuz I was getting my hair done..lol).  On the news I saw  urlLink this story.     Blew my dayum mind!  I couldn't believe what I was watching!  This is effed up!  Why they gon put Sweetie to sleep?  Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaan the owner, a little old lady, was so devastated on the news she kept on saying, "Oh! This is too much!  I can't take it!  They're gonna kill my Sweetie!"  Okay does anyone see something wrong with this?  They don't have to do Sweetie like that.  It's just plain wrong.    Any fool knows that as small as this dog is, he is not a threat to a community.  Why they got a mug shot to him AND they said he's on death row?  The newscaster was so dramatic when he said, "Now, Sweetie is on DEATH ROW."   They act like the dog mauled somebody!  Does he look like a threat?  C'mon!!!!    I say SAVE SWEETIE and give him back to his rightful owner.  Cuz dass fucked up.  Effin' beaurocratic policy makers.  Make me ill.     SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETIIIIIEEEE!  Kinda reminds me of the grandmother on Crooklyn awf da, "QUEEENNIIIIEEEE!"    Sad shit yung.
