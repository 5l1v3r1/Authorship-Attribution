Today's Dedication     I'm dedicating today to the one and only,  urlLink  RUPAUL  .  I sent him an email telling him how much I loved his blog and he actually emailed me back!  Imagine that?  RuPaul actually emailed me wishing me a Happy New Year.  That was thoughtful and definitely made my day.  His blog is interesting to read.  It's fun to see that someone so high profile will be part of this blogging community and openly shares his daily goings-on.  That's cool.     I remember when he released his first album.  My sisters and I used to give runway all around the house listening to YOU BETTA WORK!  I wanted so bad to be a fa-byoo-luss as RU.  When I started modeling myself, I'd watch RU's variety show to learn how to be a "deeva".  Not to mention the fact that YES, I read his autobiography.  RuPaul will make many women look like donkey shit and I gotta give it to him.  It's because of him that I have this drag queen fetish.  All around DC, I've made friends with the some of the top drag queens and even got drunk and partied with some of those girls.  Man, they are funny!!!  Yes, I'd say RuPaul turned me out..LOL  SO RU!! Here's to YOU BOO!  LOL  Today is yours, mkay.
