Me and You Shall Never Part            &nbsp;   Some things are just meant to be.&nbsp; This is unbelievable!     &nbsp;   I was online today (as always) and I got IM'd from a chat pal of mine who I'll call  Nicole .&nbsp; Nicole and I have chatted off and on briefly for a period of about two years maybe. Anyway, I HAD to blog today to give her her props.     &nbsp;   THANK YOU NICOLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     &nbsp;   Okay, here's the story....     &nbsp;   The first best friend I've ever had in my life was named Ranee.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say best friend, I mean BEST FRIEND.&nbsp; This was the one person I shared everything with.&nbsp; &nbsp; She was truly the first friend I loved like she was my sister.&nbsp; I mean I couldn't make a move without  Ranee .&nbsp; I'd&nbsp;met her in 3rd grade when&nbsp;my family moved (to the hood)&nbsp;and she was the only person who DID NOT bully me...lol. Instantly, we were inseparable.&nbsp; Then her parents split up like 3 years later.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   You ever seen a little girl suffering from severe depression?&nbsp; That was me.&nbsp; No. I wasn't bullied any longer (cuz I wised up and learned how to fight), but Ranee was GONE and never to be found again.&nbsp; I did everything.&nbsp; Begged my dad to call her dad, checked the phone book, asked around, everything!&nbsp; I was forced to grow up without her and cried my way to sleep every night for&nbsp;an ENTIRE Summer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   See when you're that young, you don't exchange numbers cuz you'll see one another outside everyday or you're over each other's house.&nbsp; Besides, ONE of us always had our phone turned off so meeting in person was better..lol.&nbsp; So she couldn't call me and vice versa.&nbsp; I had to find other girls to play with and that got me into trouble sometimes.&nbsp; You know them&nbsp;little dusty girls who like to bully you cuz you're lighter skinned&nbsp;or cuz you got "good hair" (whatever the fuck that means).&nbsp; Yeh those became my friends, specifically a little bubble eyed bully that ended up being my road dawg (after I had to fight her).&nbsp;     &nbsp;   *random question*&nbsp; Why is it that the most raggedy headed, dusty, tore up looking kid will end up being the bully in every 'hood?&nbsp; I'll tell you what.&nbsp; If you kick dat bully's ass, you'll have no more prollems.     &nbsp;   Anyway, Ranee disappeared and my life had to go on.&nbsp; Often times I wondered about her but never once heard anymore about her.&nbsp; Poof......  &nbsp;  1997 was one of&nbsp;the darkest periods of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wont go into the torrid details.    &nbsp;  Out of the blue that year, my dad calls&nbsp;me.&nbsp; He tells me that I will never believe who he ran into in the grocery store.&nbsp; Guess who?&nbsp; Ranee.&nbsp; After crying like a blubbering loonbag, I sat and stared at her number for like a whole day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot believe my dad saw her!&nbsp; What does she look like?&nbsp; How is she?&nbsp; WHO IS SHE?&nbsp; All I remember was a little girl with two long ponytails.&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Finally I call her, scared to death and the rest is history.&nbsp; Yeh I'll spare you the sappy details but let's just say that we talked and talked for hours.&nbsp; She and I decided to go to the Million Woman March together to reconnect and just get to know each other again.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was one of the best things that I've ever done.&nbsp; Who better to share that experience with than my original&nbsp;G.&nbsp;   She disappeared again.&nbsp; In the meantime,&nbsp; I dumped my ex bf, came out of the closet, and became the Paris Hilton of black lesbians.&nbsp; And partied myself&nbsp;to death.&nbsp; So much so that I decided to move&nbsp;in with another best friend, Tini, right dead smack in the middle of Dupont Circle (gay DC).&nbsp; &nbsp; My whole life was a party for a period of about 4 years.&nbsp; Met Evermean...blah blah blah.&nbsp; Needless to say, Ranee and I lost contact BIG TIME.&nbsp; Hell, phone numbers change, locations change..ya know.&nbsp; I still wondered where the hell she was AGAIN.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Now we're back to today......     &nbsp;   I'm chatting with my pal Nicole and she starts asking me about one of my Flashbacks...the Jean Nate story.&nbsp; She goes on to tell me that her sister had a teacher named Miss Bussy.&nbsp; So we talk and talk ..ask questions...then it hit me!&nbsp; Um...."Is yo sister's name Ranee?!!"&nbsp; I'm sure you know the answer.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   After typing like I was on speed, I gave Nicole my number and told her to have her sister call me (while I'm trying not to cry like a complete sap).&nbsp; THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!!&nbsp; What's funny is, I've been talking to Nicole, her little sister all this time, never knowing that she's Ranee's sister!&nbsp; OMG!!!!!!&nbsp; Little sister.&nbsp; Little bad assed (when she was little) sister. OMG I remember her little tail.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   When my phone rang today, I dayum near killed myself trying to answer it but my heart was beating soooo fast.&nbsp; I'm like DAYUM.&nbsp; Is she really my guardian angel or is our friendship meant to be?&nbsp; When I spoke to her it was just like I talked to her every day of my life.&nbsp; My Ranee.&nbsp; My homie.&nbsp; My best friend.&nbsp; We agreed to meet and never lose contact again.&nbsp; She's doing very well and expecting child number 4 so her and hubby are doing great.&nbsp; YAY!!!!!     &nbsp;   So I thank you Ms. Nicole (lil bad ass) for making the connection.&nbsp; I know it's meant to be.&nbsp; She's my ORIGINAL best friend who has never left my heart.&nbsp; And even though we spent most of our lives never see one another, I still feel like we've spoken everyday.&nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Just like that AGAIN she's back in my life.&nbsp; Some things don't require an explanation....just a plain ol' 'thank ya lawd' will do.&nbsp; If it's up to me, 'we shall never part' again.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Welcome back Ranee.&nbsp; You've made my day.&nbsp; Love ya girl (and ya bad ass li'l sista too!)&nbsp; THANKS NICOLE ..mwah!     &nbsp;   lol
