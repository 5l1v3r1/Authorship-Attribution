Ode to Absolut    Will you, walk me To the edge again Shaking, lonely, and I am drinking again Woke up tonight and no one's here with me I'm giving in to you     Thanks Adema! I'm feeling yall on that.  I done gave in cuz ol' Ab done took me down.  I think there's a little man kicking the shit out of my stomach wiff some football cleats and his boy is blowing a whistle in my head.  Hold me, I'm scared!
