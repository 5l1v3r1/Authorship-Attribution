5 Minutes of Fame   I'm sitting there watching the evening news when WHOA!  I see a live broadcast in Laurel with cops everywhere.  Apparently  urlLink some fool got capped .  The reporter was doing her thing, when I noticed a cute little po-leece officer standing there with her hands in her pockets.  OMG!  IT'S EVERMEAN ON TV!!  I'm like, "Look at my baby on tv wiff da po po." LOL.  How bout I called her right there to see if I'd see her answer the phone...lol.  She did, telling me she'd call me back.  Great.  It's just like me to call my woman while she's in the middle of a crime scene.  LOL!!!  SHADDUP!  I wanted to see if my call would be broadcasted, that's all. Urrybody wanna be faymous, shit.
