PIXEL!!!!   Well folks, Pixel is doing fine.  His  urlLink owner  reports,  "Pixel is doing very well. He weighs 79 grams (should weigh 80-100 but did weigh 40 when he went into the hospital) now and started talking and singing again."   I'm so glad he's okay. I was worried about little Pixel and stuff.  He was so sick man, I thought he wasn't gonna make it and go to that ol' bird's nest in the sky.  Somebody was looking out for him.  I'm mad I actually got attached to a friggin bird I've never met!  LOL  I was just so touched when he got sick; first I thought it was funny, but then I realized  urlLink how sick he was .  As an ex-bird owner, I feel his mommy's pain.   ROCK ON PIXEL!!
