The First Fall   I got up this morning and saw snow.  Great.  No workie for Noni!  I guess it's going to be a movie day with ol' Evermean.  Right now her and Mawny are outside scraping snow off the cars.  LOL  They want me to come out and help.  BUT I'M THE WIFE!  Don't do that!  So right now I'm sitting her with my  urlLink snowsuit  zipped to the gills contemplating going outside.    Maybe I will go out there so I can gather my thoughts on Whitney's interview last night.
