Today's Dedication   I have to dedicate today to my computer.  Because I sat in front of this evil box for over 12 hours yesterday, passed out (cold) on my bed with every stitch of my clothes on.   I didn't even know it would hit me.  Tini came home around six and I must've lasted about an hour after that.  Next thing I know, I'm OUT.  Woke up at midnight last night going, "What the hell?"  Here I am again, in front of this BOX.  Talking to yall crazies.
