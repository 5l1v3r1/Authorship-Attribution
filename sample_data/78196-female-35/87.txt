BITTER AND JADED    Hmph.  Not in the mood to post anything this morning.  I have to give a shout out to my House Sister Persia Martini for her excellent idea.  I'm going to adopt or perhaps "borrow" her concept by dedicating today, October 2, 2001 to  urlLink this person .  I'm in the mood to wet some fools up right now and trust me, I got 10 knuckles lined up for combat.  Anna Mae and I had a spat.  I don't like it when we do.  I hate it actually, but imagine dating yourself and all of the manipulative tactics that you've grown to develop so well are used towards you.  Imagine that shit.  Imagine having to cuss yourself out or maybe rolling your eyes at yourself.  What would you say?  "I can't stand you today bitch, but I love you to death and I'd die if I didn't have you."?  What kinda fucked up situation is that to be in?  I don't know.  Actually, I'm not angry at anyone in particular.  I'd just like to take have 5 minutes in the ring with  urlLink "myself"  right now.  I'd prolly either get my ass beaten or go to jail for beating "her" ass.  Lose-lose situation.  So not fair.  Love stinks and then you die.  (sigh)
