Blog Cuties According to Nona...   Lot's of folks are blogging now.  I never thought it would become so popular.  I remember when I started blogging in Oct. of 2000 (won't give URL..lol) and Persia, Tini and I tried to do the group blog thing.  Didn't live long.  I've been reading quite a few blogs as of late and I find that lot's of bloggers are cuter than before.  Here are some honorable mentions cuz I think they're just too cute.    urlLink CutieErica :  urlLink blog  Andrea :  urlLink blog   urlLink Mistory :  urlLink blog  Theresa :  urlLink blog   urlLink Tara :  urlLink blog   urlLink lisa :  urlLink blog
