Thanks Lori!!!   Finally, a comments section that will work!  Even though I don't get very many, I'd like the thing to at least work.  Thanks to one of my  urlLink DW   urlLink sisters , I now have one that is fully functional.  Again, thanks so much Lori (waving).  Now if I get this ring code on here, I'll be good..lol
