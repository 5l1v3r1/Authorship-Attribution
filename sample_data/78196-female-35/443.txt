Which raises the question.&nbsp; Why in the hell did black folks use Mecuricome?&nbsp; Kids from every 'hood had red knees and elbows.&nbsp;Who knows.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;dumbass&nbsp;was prolly readin&nbsp;Prevention started that dumb shit.&nbsp; Anyway, &nbsp;I had to play being banged up off all day by tugging on my half shirt and shorts.&nbsp; AND STEERING CLEAR OF GGGGRANDMA!  &nbsp;  You know the switch must be bad anytime a little kid like me would rather look like a gutted fish than get a beatin' wiff dat switch shit.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Grandma be in her feelings too much man.  &nbsp;  Eff dat.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;
