Public Shame   I'd like to publicly shame myself by admitting that I am a deadbeat friend to someone I care very much about.  Ms. T. D. Morse.  Lemme tell yall.   This woman has been one of my ORIGINAL best friends since junior high schooI.  There was NOTHING that we didn't share...ever!  We were closer than ever for over ten years until we both went our seperate ways and basically stopped calling each other.  I'll say that I was the one who made my calls less frequent (due to a plethora of relationship dramas).  I sent her an email today just to say hello and she stressed how she read my blog faithfully.  I know that's her way of making sure I'm okay.  But I have not called her in soooo long nor have I visited her (it's a crying shame - she's local).  I kinda just fell off, did my own thing, kept her in my heart, you know?    Now that we both have our own seperate lives it's really hard to pick up where we left off.     Ms. Morse, I'd just like to tell you that I love you dearly and I've never stopped.  We had some really fun times.  You've made me laugh, cry, think, reflect..whatever.  You've also helped me make some pretty tough decisions in my life.  I just wish I had the courage to tell you about my orientation earlier so I had you to talk to.   Not your fault, I chose to stay away (for obvious reasons..keyword: CLOSET)  We may not talk often or even see each other, but I want you to know that you're still one of my best friends.   I know I'm a deadbeat and apologize (wholeheartedly) for that.  You didn't expect this, I know.  But some things, even the smallest gestures, make you think.  I did.
