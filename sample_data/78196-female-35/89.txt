WE PARTIED WITH THIS FOOL!      After going to the protest on Saturday afternoon, I hooked up with  urlLink my cousin  to go to  urlLink our usual spot  to see the "entertainment".   We're standing there watching the "entertainment", and guess who shows up?  Uncle Luke...LOL  Why did my cousin jump on him with her arms around his neck shouting, "I luh yoo Luke!  I luh you!  You taught me how to pop my coochie and I made up a dance off of your song!!" He just grinned and looked at her all crazy.  Then the "entertainment" got ugly.  All types of shit was happening with clothes flying and hips moving.  I'mma leave it right dere.
