Don't Call It a Comeback   I know!  I done yall real wrong by being away so long.  Sorry!!  A sista was trying to make a dollar out of fi-teen cents..dass awl.    Can we talk about my job for a minute?  Three words: hateful older women.  They hate me and I love it!  Soon my dear friends, I will announce and introduce a replacement for Big Shoulders!  Yes, you heard me right.  Big Shoulders has been outdone!  I gots me a new old bitter bitch to rag on and I'm going to get my LIFE!!!  I'll post an update after the naming ceremony.  In other news, shit's cool on my end.  In the past month, I've drank myself retarded, smoked out like a fiend (as per usual) and pretty much spent the rest my time riding shotgun with Evermean.  And we're surviving the Summer!  I guess that's not too bad.  Can't complain.    Things at the crib are aight.  Sunshine is a complete NUTBALL.  Girl spends practically every evening at happy hour, weekends at any bar nearby, and the rest of the time trying to shag hot boys.  It's hilarious.  Little Ms. Portland Oregon is awf da chain!  And she fuck wit kreg enem.  She's actually created her own DC version of Sex and the City.  No bullshit.  Tini and I just laugh at her silly ass.     Random thought:  I'm in love with  urlLink this  girl.  I accidentally landed on her picture and then ACCIDENTALLY FELL OUT.   I'd like to give a shout to my girl,  urlLink Cutie Erica .  Congratulations pretty girl!  *w*
