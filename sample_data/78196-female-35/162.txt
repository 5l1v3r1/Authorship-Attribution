Self Realization   You know close friends have a way of telling you shit to make you think. I was telling Tini about my conversation with the ex-bf.  Told her about how we shared truths and blah blah blah.  She hit me with the quote of the week, referring to my behavior towards him after the breakup:  "You was mean as a black snake lying on hot pavement"   That shit was funny.  I was and I aint 'fraid to admit.  I was a mean, surly bitch carrying an emotional blade that would've made Jesus Christ himself cry bloody tears (no blaspheme intended).  I am also mature enough to say I'm sorry, which I have done.  I still want to poke his eyes out, but he didn't really deserve the punishment, though it was a blast.
