I'm So Glad   Robin got booted off of America's Top Model.  That bitch made me wanna choke her.  Fake assed religion freak.  I got so sick of her trying to "bind" and "rebuke" everything.  But the truth came out in the end (as it always does) and she tried so hard to deny it.  There's nothing worse than a fake, judgemental, Bible-quoting Christian who tries to down others for their alternative beliefs and lifestyles, and interpretations of the spiritual world.   That's the reason why this world is in the current state right now.  Narrow-minded religious finatics who like to act superior and point the finger at and destroy the so-called "evil-doers".    I barely watched that show because of her ignorant ass.  She ain't call on Jesus when she got caught in those lies did she?  Stupid cunt.    I'm glad Adrienne won.  No bullshit.  She kept her shit real the entire time.  Good for her.  The sad part is...Robin is very pretty and has a great body.  But her attitude and concept of life is fucked.  She lives in a BOX.  Guess it's dem dayum pageants....lol.
