Rescue Me!!    This was the day from hell!  First of all, Tini and I had to call the fuzz on our landlord.  Why?  He just decided he wanted to chill in our apartment.  Okay.  We went out today to file a complaint against him for harrassment.  Came back, and the fool was in our place!  So instead of being locked up for splitting his head wide open, I called the cops.  I guess he figured our that little clause in our lease meant he can just walk in when he wants.  NOPE.     So since this morning, we've gone to the housing officials to file code violation complaints, talked to the cops, started the retraining order process, contacted a landlord/tenant attorney, and prayed to the heaven's that he not come up in this piece again!  If he does...TRUBBA.     I missed a day of work cuz of this.  I'm backed up on two major projects, thanks to Mr. "I wanna bring my flamboyant ass in and sniff draws".   Once I do that it's oun.  Tini and I are gonna burn some leaves out back.  She has to DJ tonight.  But me?  I'm prolly gonna do some ill shit like watch Strictly Ballroom.  LOL  A ritual around these parts.  Hell,  urlLink Fran's father  is the shit!
