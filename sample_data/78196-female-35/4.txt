urlLink 3 Doors Down  has a song called Kryptonite and the hook made me think of Officer EverMean:    If I go crazy then will you still Call me Superman If Im alive and well,  Will you be there holding my hand Ill keep you by my side  With my superhuman might Kryptonite     I'm a lyric slut.  This may be an everyday thing. I'll prolly have a regular shout-out..."these lyrics go out to my dawg back in Marshall Terrace"...lol   Good idea.
