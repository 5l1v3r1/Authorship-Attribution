The Heels Are Alive!!!       After work last night, I went to the annual  urlLink drag    urlLink race  in Dupont Circle. Maaaan it was so dayum funny!  I wonder sometimes where these men get their creativity from.  I'm telling you.  They had everything from your typical catwoman (in 8 inch stiletto boots) to the entire cast of Scooby Doo.  They were even giving  urlLink this  look (left), boat and everything!      Of course I was drunk off my ass, but of what I remember, it was really cute and funny.  Some guys didn't even bother to shave to look "girly", they just put on some pumps and ran like hell...LMAO.  The killer was this  urlLink phat to def "chick" we called tits and ass .  She had the nerve to prance down 17th street with a lime green leopard catsuit.  I can't even describe the laughter and hysteria when "ms thang" walked by.
