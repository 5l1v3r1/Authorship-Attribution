Dishpan Hands   OMG!  Why is it that we don't notice ash until we get outside?  I have ashy hands like you wouldn't believe!  I'm outside taking my usual cigg break and look down at my hands.  I swear they look like I've been playing badminton with no raquet in the middle of a sand storm.  I could probably write my name on the concrete bearhanded.  Ooooh I hope nobody pisses me off today cuz if they get slapped, that would be very bad.  Not only will they have a red slap print but they'll probably look like they just applied fresh white pancake makeup.  What gives?  Somebody find my Jergen's. I bet you if somebody gave me five, they'd leave me with bleeding paws.  This has got to stop!
