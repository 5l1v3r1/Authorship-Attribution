Sippin On Glizzaze      America.  We need to start protesting these marketing teams who come up with crazy shit to keep our fat asses snackin'. I bet you they are comprised of mostly young, skinny, stoners who want to make money on us fatties.  Side note:  Please don't confuse 'fatties' with 'swoles'.  'Fatties' are a little misunderstood in certain areas.  Take me for instance.  A certified 'fatty'.  I gotta backup chin that needs Jesus and two Twinkies in my back that I'm bout to fight.  'Swoles'.  Can't really speak for them.  Put it this way.  I know 'em when I see 'em.    Now. We all know Krispy Kreme Donuts are the best dayumed guilty pleasure the mouth could ever taste right? Dey done came up with some ill shit.  See. I check up on one of my favorite funny blogs, Uncle Bob.  urlLink  And I saw this  I'M OUTRAGED! But I wont go off this time..lol. Uncle Bob has a way of describing things that make them sooo funny. Let him attem!!  urlLink  Here's his take on this topic .   All imma say is...I'll git glazed, but I'll be dayumed if imma sippit. Then again, that may be fun (wink)...lol
