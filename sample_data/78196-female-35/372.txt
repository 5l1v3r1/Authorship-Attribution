I'm going to get off my ass and do something this time.  Evermean and I have decided to participate in the Race for the Cure.  As of late, she and I have run into a few people who are either newly diagnosed or still survivin'.  To:  Bunny's coworker, Prox, Hellisha's mom, The McMurray Family (lost a daughter)  You are my motivating forces for attending this race.
