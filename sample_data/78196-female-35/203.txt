Hallelujah/Al Hamdulillah    I'm giving the HIGHEST POWER the HIGHEST PRAISE.  I just got a check (didn't expect it) and now my rent will be paid on time.    I never claimed to be a holy or sinless person, but I do in fact believe in a higher power.  The Creator has a way of still letting you know that He's there.  Even when you're insanely involved in iniquity (like Yours Truly), He still has your back.  He still has an interesting way of reminding you that "It's gon' be okay".  I know some of you may say, "Nah Nona, that was da gubment who sent you that check."  I say, OFF WITH YOUR HEADS.  I believe what I want to believe.     Yesterday, Vida Verde and I were talking about a few things involving spiritual paths, The Creator, blah blah blah.  Sort of about what I'm going to do with this ol' life o' mine (jobwise, etc.) and how I need to settle this ol' caboose down.  Today when I got my check, this came to mind:   For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. (Matthew 18:19-2)     I guess He was.  Cuz He sent the mailman to my box today.  And I am so thankful for it.  For real.
