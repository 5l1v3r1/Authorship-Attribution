ISO Happy Times     We need to go back to the music styles of the 80's.  It think folks were much happier and positive back then.  We may have been serious fashion victims but we were some happy some-ma-bitches.  Remember how happily we used to dance looking into our partner's eyes?  Remember all those goofy beach and young love movies we used to watch?  I think we were much happier than seriously.  Not to take anything away from grunge or alternative music or even hip-hop, but there is something that took away that bubbly "popcorn love" feeling we used to have.  Back when Milli Vanilli was considered "sexy" ... LOL    Right now the way shit is, I could soooo go back to the 80's.  I may have to wear one-shouldered neon shirts and leg warmers, but I'll sacrifice my " urlLink diva " look for a simple " urlLink bad hair 80's chick " anyday simply so we can get our normal lives back.  Cuz these days bite!
