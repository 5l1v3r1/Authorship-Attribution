Preacher Gone Mad   I'm about sick of Jerry Faldwell's ass.  Why doesn't he just shut the fuck up?  Gosh!   Every time he says something publicly, he has to  urlLink apologize  for it.  Shouldn't he have learned his lession by now?  I mean come on Jerry!  He isn't happy unless he's got someone to pick on.  Why doesn't he pick on these fake assed priests who are having sex with young boys?  Why doesn't he pick on these churches who've collected for their Building Fund for the past 20 years and the preacher is driving a Caddy with platinum fronts?  How about that Jerry?!!  You wanna talk about religious extremism?  KEYWORD: Jerry Faldwell, mkay? Unless you are pro-life, straight, Christian, and think the Teletubbies are evil, you are the damned?  Fuck you Jerry Faldwell (and tell a friend)!  You are a swolen-faced fraud who thinks that unless shit is your way, it's not of God.  Hmph...    Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves .  Taken from the Book of  urlLink Matthew, Chapter 7.
