If one reads UFO and abduction literature, the answer is obvious... Grey aliens are here to wipe out mankind in effort to repopulate earth with alien-human hybrids. Abductees are often shown images of hybrids living peacefully in a grassy, sunny, post-apocalyptic utopia, enjoying their new planet; normal humans left were nothing more than docile slaves similar to those of Planet of the Apes or The Time Machine. In addition, Grey aliens are known to often reside on earth, but underground. All of this is significant because not only do the Teletubbies resemble cuddly carricatures of hybrids (with their pale and hairless faces, large-irised eyes, and improportionately big heads), but they live in a grassy Utopian Teletubbieland where the only live human-like creatures around are the rabbits, and where a home is a domed burried spaceship complete with sliding doors and metallic interior.
