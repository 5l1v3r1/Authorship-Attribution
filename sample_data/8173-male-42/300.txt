urlLink Record ice loss in Arctic  Polar sea ice has an important function in moderating the global energy balance. Sea ice has albedo of 0.8. That is, it reflects 80% of the solar radiation. When the sea ice melts you have water, which has an albedo of 0.2.  The sea ice goes from absorbing 20% of solar radiation to absorbing 80%. This creates positive feedback for further warming.
