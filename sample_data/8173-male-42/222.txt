urlLink May 2001: What are those words that trigger Echelon?  There are the obvious phrases like "Kill the President" which caused two schoolboys from the UK to be quizzed by special branch, "anarchy", "echelon" :-), "nuclear", "assassinate". Then there are ones that are dodgy (cause they fit in with X-file type paranoia) like "Roswell", "Waco", "World Trade Center", "Soros" - after George Soros, "Whitewater".  Maybe even "post-atomic"?.... Oh my... now who could that be at this hour?
