urlLink A maybe state of mind  Thirty years ago on July 23, 1973, Robert Anton Wilson got a message from an extraterrestrial from Sirius.  Or maybe it was a 6-foot tall white rabbit from County Kerry.  Whoever Wilsons messenger was (he concedes that maybe he was just talking to himself), it came just in time.  ...also, just in time to save me from being a Cosmic Schmuck, my own copy of the limited edition  urlLink Maybe Logic  DVD arrived today! Including a bearer card that makes me a TZAR -  authorized by The House of The Apostles Of Eris - I wanted to be a POPE, but what the hell, you pays your money, you takes your chances...
