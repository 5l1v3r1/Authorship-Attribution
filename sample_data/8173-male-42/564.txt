urlLink The Socialist Pledge of Allegiance  Possibly someday historians can explain why so many Americans came to consider the Pledge of Allegiance a sign of the utmost patriotism... I don't see a pledge or loyalty oath for nave children in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, or any of the writings of the Founding Fathers.   Maybe someday people will pledge their allegiance to the US Constitution and not to a piece of cloth.
