LOCKHART: The enemy has very deceitfully taken advantage of the Tet ceasefire to launch an offensive all over the country. So far, we've had it pretty easy here. But we seem to be the exception.  Charlie has hit every major military target in Vietnam, and hit 'em hard. In Saigon, the United States Embassy has been overrun by suicide squads. Khe Sahn is standing by to be overrun. We also have reports that a division of N.V.A. has occupied all of the city of Hue south of the Perfume River. In strategic terms, Charlie's cut the country in half... the civilian press are about to wet their pants and we've heard even Cronkite's going to say the war is now unwinnable.  In other words, it's a huge shit sandwich, and we're all gonna have to take a bite.  (Long, serious pause.)  JOKER:  urlLink Sir... does this mean that Ann-Margret's not coming?   --- Full Metal Jacket
