From an email, sent to me by the Illuminati...  "Yet this one rule I advise you to observe, that you communicate vulgar secrets to vulgar friends, but higher and secret to higher, and secret friends only. Give hay  to an ox, sugar to a parrot only; understand my meaning, lest you be trod under the oxen's feet, as oftentimes it falls out." -- John Tritemius, abbot of Saint James of Heriopolis, to Henry Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim
