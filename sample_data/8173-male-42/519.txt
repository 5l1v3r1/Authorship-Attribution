urlLink Bush's "Christian" Blood Cult: Concerns Raised by the Vatican  George W. Bush proclaims himself a born-again Christian. However, Bush and fellow self-anointed neo-Christians appear to wallow in a "Christian" blood lust cult when it comes to practicing the teachings of the founder of Christianity.  This cultist form of Christianity, with its emphasis on death rather than life, is also worrying the leaders of mainstream Christian religions, particularly the Pope.  Bush's blood lust, his repeated commitment to Christian beliefs, and his constant references to "evil doers," in the eyes of many devout Catholic leaders, bear all the hallmarks of the one warned about in the Book of Revelations - the anti-Christ.  People close to the Pope claim that amid these concerns, the Pontiff wishes he was younger and in better health to confront the possibility that Bush may represent the person prophesized in Revelations.
