urlLink Killer Russian Bears Knock Off People with Rock Slides  I am talking about the dreaded Caucasian bear. I have heard a lot of stories about how it kills cows. A bear sits somewhere in the mountains. As soon as it sees a cow, it starts pushing rocks down. This is the way it kills people.  The bears probably do this for their own entertainment.
