urlLink   If you were really on the conspiratorial side, (should we raise our hands?), you might say that, hypothetically speaking, the filing of a ludicrous court petition charging George W. Bush with rape -- and we are just speaking hypothetically of the future (not of any existing lawsuit) -- would benefit Bush in the long run.  It's called "innoculating" an issue.  Isn't that special? Hmmm?
