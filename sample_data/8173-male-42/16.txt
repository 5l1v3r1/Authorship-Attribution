urlLink How to Cook an Alien   Aliens come here uninvited.  They ate Elvis.  They mutilate our cattle, and probe abductees by shoving probes in their rectum and performing other unspeakable acts upon unsuspecting victims.  They are plentiful, more plentiful than the strained seas and land resources, and they seem to be coming in increasing numbers (if you beleive what some people are saying).  They are Kosher meat.  They taste good if prepared well.  According to some,they mess around with the Space Shuttle, when astronauts launch sattelites.  Their meat is safer than British Beef.  Via  urlLink Juul
