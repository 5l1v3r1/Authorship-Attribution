urlLink August 2002: Ashcroft's Hellish Vision  Since the nation will never be entirely safe from terrorism, liberty has become a mere rhetorical justification for increased security.   Ashcroft is a catalyst for constitutional devolution, encouraging citizens to accept autocratic rule as their only way of avoiding massive terrorist attacks.   His greatest problem has been preserving a level of panic and fear that would induce a free people to surrender the rights so dearly won by their ancestors.   urlLink November 2003: Police-State-Patriotism  John Ashcroft has already demonstrated to the people of this nation that little evidence is required prior to incarceration. If I am not mistaken, Heinrich Himmler originally intended his camps to be used for political nonconformists, and others suspected as enemies of the German "Fatherland."  Does it not gnaw on your sense of security to know that the Attorney General and President can condemn--through an unconstitutionally clandestine "committee"--any citizen as an "enemy combatant" of the American "Homeland"?
