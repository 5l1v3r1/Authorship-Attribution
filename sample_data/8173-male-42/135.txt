urlLink Radioactive battery provides decades of power  Tiny batteries that draw energy from radioactive isotopes could provide 50 years of power for micro-devices and electronics, its inventors say.  Batteries based on radioactive energy sources were first suggested in the 1960s during a boom in nuclear power research. Many of these were shelved because of public safety concerns.   urlLink Scientists show off ray gun drill  Scientists have unveiled a space-age ray gun drill that uses microwaves to bore through concrete, rock or glass.  "On the other hand, the drill emits hazardous radiation, which requires safety measures and limits its operating conditions."
