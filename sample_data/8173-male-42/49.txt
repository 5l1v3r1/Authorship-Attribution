urlLink Hiroshima Day: One hell of a big bang  One last thing, when you hear people say, "Let's nuke 'em," "Let's nuke these people," what do you think?   Oh, I wouldn't hesitate if I had the choice. I'd wipe 'em out. You're gonna kill innocent people at the same time, but we've never fought a damn war anywhere in the world where they didn't kill innocent people. If the newspapers would just cut out the shit: "You've killed so many civilians." That's their tough luck for being there.
