Basically  urlLink sTaRe  has been shut down by the hosting company, and I'm still trying to get a legitimate reason from them.  Every time I call, I get another reason and when I show them that they are wrong, they change the reason. (!?)  So far they have accused us of:  *Sorry, it's a billing error. When I told them to check their invoice records and see that we're prepaid until the end of Q4 2004 the reason changed to-  *We were shut down due to our hosting of "inappropriate material" When pushed to define, inappropriate and point out WHAT on our site fit this description, they switched to-  *Accusing us of using incunabula.org for spamming.  When I challenged them to produce evidence of this I was told by the manager, in these EXACT words: " urlLink We can shut off your account whenever we want to and we don't have to give you a reason !"  When I reminded him that we have been a customer in good standing and have even referred several clients to them and that maybe we could simply be allowed copy only FTP access so we could back up our assets and move hosting services since they obviously weren't interested in keeping us as a customer, he said, "Maybe, but probably not."   I then replied, "Let me get this straight. You're saying, we've been shut down and locked out, it's not about billing but you can't be specific about what it is exactly that caused you to do this and I have to not only live with that answer, eat the prepaid that I'm losing, but also lose my web assets, move my host (more costs to me), and more for...well, you can't exactly say why, but that I should do all this because you can make me. End of story?"  His reply. "Yep."  Spread it far and wide.  The hosting service is called: Hostsave.com
