urlLink Tribulation 99: Alien Anomalies Under America  (Realmedia) With a sci-fi plot suggesting that current unrest can be blamed on space aliens who live under U.S. atomic test sites, the film illustrates its lurid comic drama with images culled from everyting from newsreels to Mexican horror flicks. This nutty little item suggests that conspiracy thinking is a Frankenstein monster which inevitably destroys its  urlLink creator  (First you have the conspiracy theory, and then the conspiracy theory has you).   By the way,  urlLink FSTV needs donations.
