urlLink Professor X  The Shulgins can come across like a psychedelic version of the Osbournes  an ambling, eccentric paterfamilias, a kid who's caught up in the family business, and a savvier, more aggressive wife who protects them from the outside world.  Shulgin has some establishment leanings. He belongs to the elite, all-male  urlLink Bohemian Club  (Dick Cheney and George Shultz are members)...  Heh heh, here Dick, put this on your tongue...
