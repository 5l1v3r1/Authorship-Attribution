urlLink Before the Flood, There Was No Moon  ...after the Moon was created, it orbited far away from the Earth. A space object flew near the Moon, which caused the moon to change its orbit. The Moon moved closer to the Earth and became imprisoned by the Earths gravity.   Then, the Moon became the master of Earths waters. The Moons approach resulted in immense tides, volcano eruptions, and earthquakes. Waves were the height of mountains, volcanoes were erupting, and water was boiling. Probably, the new satellite was the reason for the Great Flood.
