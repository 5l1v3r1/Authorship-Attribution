urlLink The Passion of the Christ: Blooper Reel  Christ, shackled to a stone, is being scourged by Roman soldiers. Blood runs down his gory back. His pain is palpable.   Jesus: [writhes in pain, hands shaking]  [Cell phone rings.]  Jesus: [hands shake furiously]  [Cell phone rings. Caviezel looks up, sheepish.]  Roman soldier: Jim? That you?  Jesus: Yeah.  [Cell phone rings.]  Soldier: Want me to get it?  Jesus: Yeah.  [Roman soldier gingerly reaches into Caviezels blood-soaked loincloth, pulls out phone and opens it, then holds the phone to Caviezels ear.]  Off Camera: [laughter]   Jesus: Hey, Mom.  ---   Volunteer: Let me down ! Oh God, the pain, the pain!   Scientist: Be quiet and let me check your shroud...hmm...some blood, some sweat and filth, but no human image on the cloth yet. I guess you'll have to stay tied to the cross some more.   Volunteer: But I've been hanging here for three days, please, get me down. The stab wound is really starting to hurt and all you've given me to drink is vinegar. The sun is really really hot, and this shroud is very itchy.   Scientist: This is science, I must replicate the conditions exactly. Remember our lord had the shroud wrapped around him for 27 days. We're barely into the third day and you're already wimping out? You got your five dollars, so stay quiet!   Volunteer: Oh, reputable scientific establishment...why have you forsaken me?
