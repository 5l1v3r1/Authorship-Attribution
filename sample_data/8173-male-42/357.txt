urlLink This is Relton DuPiniot, The Blogeur , and he's the cleanest man in the world.  Almost makes you sick doesn't it?  I've been waiting for this tower of good bloggy-taste to link my website for three years, and now... Now that it's happened, I can retire and give up the whole business.  Hah, you wish. But thanks, R. It's all been worthwhile.
