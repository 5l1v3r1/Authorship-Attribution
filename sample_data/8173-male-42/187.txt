urlLink China tries to control Tibet with 'soul boy'  Portraits of the official Panchen Lama, looking somewhat bewildered in his Buddhist robes, have been erected in temples in the Tashilhunpo monastery.  But outside, on the city streets, it is clear that there is no public affection for the boy.  Determined to keep a firm grip on the Buddhist leadership, Beijing insisted that the reincarnated Panchen Lama must be born on Chinese territory -- excluding the exile community, which has defied China's wishes. It refused to consult the exiled Dalai Lama, accusing him of being a meddlesome outsider.
