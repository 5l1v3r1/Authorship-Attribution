urlLink The Lone Dissenter  ( urlLink via Page3Girls ) Fifi, Ricky, and I got together today to continue our debate from yesterday.   Ricky: So, you're a Republican, right?  Me: Actually, no. I consider myself a conservative. (yeah, that's what they all say) Maybe even a conservative-leaning libertarian. (and then they say this)  Fifi: Um, sorry, don't you mean liberal?  Me: No. Libertarian. [Insert description of libertarians.]  Ricky: So, what's a libertarian stance on some issue, then?  Me: Um, drugs, for instance. I think that drugs should be legalized.  Fifi: What? Like, cocaine? Heroin? That sort of drug?  Me: Yes.  Ricky: But what if someone ODs and dies?  Me: Then it'd stink to be them, wouldn't it? Seriously, I don't care. If they're dumb enough to do that, it's just as well they're out of the gene pool.  Fifi: How can you say that? I mean, are you just going to legalize drugs and laugh when people die?  Me: No. I'm going to legalize drugs, educate people about them, and impose high taxes. Look at it this way. Who has a better idea of whether you should have drugs, you or the government?  Fifi: The government, of course. Are you crazy? What do you think it's there for? (insert sitcom laugh track here)
