We're located in the Florida Panhandle, a.k.a. the Republican Redneck Riviera. We believe we're a few of only 12 or so Democrats left in northwest Florida. After the shocking events of the 2000 Presidential election, we established the website Floridagate, now  urlLink AllHatNoCattle.net , in the hope that humor would help us get through the next four years of the Dubya administration. As Floridians, we were appalled that Jeb Bush, Katherine Harris and the U.S. Supremes would select our president instead of seeking a fair and accurate count of all the votes.
