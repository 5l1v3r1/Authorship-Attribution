Could it trigger the end of the world as we know it?   No, say a wide range of Bible scholars.   Even those fundamentalists who adhere to a very strict line of end-times prophecy say more has to happen first.   urlLink Onward Bush's soldiers  Armageddon may or may not be televised. But if Dr. Mike Evans has his way, his newly launched Evangelical Israel Broadcasting Network will be broadcasting directly from the scene. Dr. Evans, who heads the Jerusalem Prayer Team, believes a war with Iraq could be a "dress rehearsal for Armageddon" -- the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.
