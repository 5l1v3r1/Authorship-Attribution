urlLink Extension Room - use the Throbber to "BlogThis"  Here's a bit of code I just found that can be inserted into the user.js file of Mozilla Firefox and turn the Throbber into a BlogThis! button.  Works much better than the BlogThis! from Blogger which always opens behind the Firefox browser and has to be brought forward to work with it. Kind of a pain in the ass.  You may want to install the ChromEdit extension to insert this code, which I'm going to paste here just in case the page it comes from disappears for whatever reason...  // Throbber Location point to Blog This: user_pref('browser.throbber.url', 'javascript:Q='';x=document;y=window;if (x.selection){Q=x.selection.createRange().text;}else if(y.getSelection){Q=y.getSelection();}else if(x.getSelection){Q=x.getSelection();}void (window.open('http://new.blogger.com/blog_this.pyra?t=' escape(Q) '&u=' escape(location.href) '&n=' escape(document.title),'bloggerForm','scrollbars=no,width=475, height=300,top=175,left=75,status=yes,resizable=yes'));');"
