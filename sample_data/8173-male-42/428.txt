urlLink The Flag Flap  Is the American flag, battle emblem of the U.S. government, supposed to be "sacred"? Are we to make a religion of statolatry? What sort of grotesque religion is that?   ...if burning the flag is to be banned, are we to clap numerous American Legion or VFW people in the hoosegow? Oh, you say that intent is the crucial point, and that you want to outlaw hippie types who burn U.S. flags with a sneer and a curse. But how are the police supposed to figure out intent, and make sure that the majesty of the law falls only upon hippie-sneerers, and spares reverent, saluting Legionnaires?( urlLink via )   urlLink Fuck That Flag  ...the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. No. They must take the flag to the VFW Hall. There they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on. Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.
