urlLink Forced medication: When does it violate rights?  A St. Louis dentist accused of insurance and Medicaid fraud is fighting an effort by the US government to forcibly inject him with antipsychotic drugs, to render him competent to stand trial.  For nearly four years, Charles Thomas Sell has fought a losing court battle to avoid the unwanted medication. He says it is a form of government-authorized mind control in violation of his First Amendment right to freedom of thought.   urlLink Insanity Goes Back on Trial  The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, in an amicus brief, warns of "mind control" and draws an analogy between Mr. Sell and Winston Smith, the hero of Orwell's "1984." The Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics contends that administering the medications would be "cognitive censorship" and that Mr. Sell is under "no obligation to think the way the government wants him to think." The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers lodged similar protests.
