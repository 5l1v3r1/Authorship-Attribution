urlLink Death and Hell  ...in the 18 months before my death, I proceeded to set forth the Keys to Death and Hell. In this process I envisioned a snapshot of the world as it appeared to me at that time. Literally a cutup, a cut and paste sculpture taken from various articles, science fiction, cultural and political events, happenings in the realms of occulture, flame wars on the Zee list, my life, my world, my email etc., so it was just a cut-up of these things.
