urlLink What's the trendiest way to protest government cybersnooping?  Spam. That's the idea behind SuPerVillainizer, an automated "conspiracy" app that churns out emails peppered with words and phrases designed to trigger Switzerland's electronic surveillance system.   urlLink SuPerVillainizer  is about creating profiles of villains, rogues, bad guys, and scapegoats, equipping them with real email accounts at a Swiss provider, uniting them into conspiracies, and then watching as the villains start to automatically communicate with each other using SuPerVillainizer-generated conspiracy content, infiltrating the carefully planned surveillance system with more and more disinfoming mails every day.
