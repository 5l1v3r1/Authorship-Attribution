urlLink UFO Politics  For one reason or the other, many people feel that the issue of UFOs and ET life is somewhat of a joke. In your opinion, why is this the case?  While the number of people worldwide who takes this issue seriously grows every day, there are many who do not. The reason for this is simple: a government orchestrated management of the issue since the 1940s. Propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, covert actions, subversion, disruption and misdirection were used to embargo the core truth during the Cold War. It was the view (perhaps correctly so) of the United States government that introduction of the extraterrestrial reality during this period of nuclear deterrence - mutual assured destruction (MAD) - was too risky.  The Cold War is over. Its time to move on.
