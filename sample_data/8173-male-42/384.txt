urlLink Sympathy For The Devil   Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June, We stood beneath an amber moon And softly murmured "someday soon." We kissed and clung together, Then, tomorrow was another day The morning found me miles away With still a million things to say; Now, when twilight dims the sky above Recalling thrills of our love, There's one thing I'm certain of Return I will to old Brazil.   By these terrible means, they will create a world where war conducted by any country but the United States will seem simply too risky and the Great American Peace will begin.  Unregulated Global Corporatism will be the only permissible ideology, every human will have access to McDonald's and the Home Shopping Network, all "news" will come through some variant of AOLTimeWarnerCNN, the Internet will be run by Microsoft, and so it will remain for a long time. Peace. On Prozac.  If I were in charge, this is neither the flavor of peace I would prefer nor the way I would achieve it. But if I'd been in charge back in 1983, there might still be a Soviet Union and we might all still be waiting for the world to end in fifteen nuclear minutes. (We aren't?)  Of course, I could be completely wrong about this. Maybe they actually are possessed of a madness to which there is no method. Maybe they really do intend to invade Iraq and for no more noble reason than giving American SUVs another 50 years of cheap gas.  We'll probably know which it's going to be sometime in the next fortnight.  By then, I expect to be dancing in Brazil, far from this heart of darkness and closer to the heart itself...
