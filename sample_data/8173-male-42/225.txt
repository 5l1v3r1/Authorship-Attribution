urlLink Prehistoric Cyborgs and Modern Man  The mummy was discovered in a block of ice in Central Mongolia in 1995. It was in the ice within four thousand years. Some of the internals and several parts of the brain were made of unknown artificial materials.   The surgical manipulation performed on the mummy was designed to create a perfect cyborg, which could carry out observations and collect data. The scientists say that during its life, the mummy could have been a cyborg, a creature made by a combination of features of a robot and a hominoid.
