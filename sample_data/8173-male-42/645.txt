urlLink NASA hides the true colours of Mars      So the story goes:  urlLink Richard C. Hoagland , Gene Roddenberry, and Ray Bradbury, are all at NASA watching the first photos of the Martian surface come in from Viking back in the 70's. The first photo looks like the Arizona desert with blue skies. One of them says, "Might expect a prospector and his burro to appear any moment..." They agree.  After the first photo, NASA techs scramble to adjust all the video monitors - now all the following photos appear with pink skies.  One lone technician wanders around and re-adjusts the monitors for the proper color - he promptly gets arrested.  Anyway, thats Richard's story. Or - was it Stanton Friedman?   urlLink Why is the Sky Blue?  ( urlLink via )
