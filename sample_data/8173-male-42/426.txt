Assuming the current situation with Iraq leads to combat activity by US troops, I suggest we get a small film crew credentialed as press to shoot over there. This will solve some of the budget vs. production value problems we?ve discussed. In the best case scenario we can also get one or two of our leads over there in costume to do a scene with the mayhem of real war as a backdrop. [Take a look at pages 65, 72-74, and 96 for examples that lend themselves.]  Failing this, we can have the war as a back plate to use with blue screen of our actors or to add CGI on.   urlLink We'll be the only movie with a multi billion dollar effects budget.
