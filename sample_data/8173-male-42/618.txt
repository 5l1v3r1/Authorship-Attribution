urlLink The Christmas Conspiracy  We've all heard of "conspiracy" theories of history. Great events in history didn't "just happen," we are told, but they were planned by conspiratorial architects, acting in secret, hiding their true intentions from the ignorant masses, and carried out by dedicated, brainwashed, or fanatical followers. The founding of the Federal Reserve System, the assassinations of both Kennedys, Martin Luther King, and even John Lennon, were all planned beforehand by people in high places, in order to solidify their power. At least some people think so.  Even if all these conspiracy theories are true, they pale in significance compared to the greatest conspiracy of them all: The Christmas Conspiracy. This conspiracy is no mere theory, but inescapable fact. ( urlLink via )
