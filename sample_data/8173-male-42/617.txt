urlLink The Story of Mouseland by Tommy Douglas  You see, my friends, the trouble wasn't with the colour of the cat. The trouble was that they were cats. And because they were cats, they naturally looked after cats instead of mice.  Presently there came along one little mouse who had an idea. My friends, watch out for the little fellow with an idea. And he said to the other mice, "Look fellows, why do we keep electing a government made up of cats? Why don't we elect a government made up of mice?" "OH," they said, "he's a Bolshevik. Lock him up!" So they put him in jail.  But I want to remind you: That you can lock up a mouse or a man but you can't lock up an idea.

Kicking the dog is cruel and brutal and it is humiliating to be called a fruit. But in comparison to our real problem  in comparison to the fact that the ship is still heading north  your grievances are petty and trivial, because if we dont get this ship turned around soon, were all going to drown.  Fascist! said the professor.  Counterrevolutionary! said the lady passenger. And all of the passengers and crew chimed in one after another, calling the cabin boy a fascist and a counterrevolutionary. They pushed him away and went back to grumbling about wages, and about blankets for women, and about the right to suck cocks, and about how the dog was treated. The ship kept sailing north, and after a while it was crushed between two icebergs and everyone drowned.
