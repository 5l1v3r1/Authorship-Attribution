urlLink The Connection: Culture of Conspiracy  (RealPlayer Required) It's simple, really. There's a small, powerful group who knows a lot more than you do. These people are driven by lust for power, or money, or by pure evil, and "they" are the ones controlling events. All kinds of events, and very little happens by chance. That, according to classic conspiracy theory, is how the world is run. One problem: there's plenty of debate over who "they" are. Could be the CIA, the Catholic Church, the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateralists, Jews, Masons, the aliens who landed in Roswell, or a chilling combination of the above, which I could tell you about, but then I'd have to kill you.   urlLink The Connection: Lunar Lunacy  (RealPlayer Required) For most people, the Apollo missions are historical fact.

Why? ... only the shadow knows.
