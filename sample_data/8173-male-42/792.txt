urlLink Final Post - And Why I Will Vote For Baby Bush  ...it dawned on me. I really don't like mankind. Oh, I like most individuals I meet, but mankind in general? Well, I don't think I'd cross the street to save it.  In fact, I think I'll vote for George Bush' re-election. I think he and his policies will bring about the destruction of mankind faster than anything short of an errant asteroid or the sudden implosion of our sun.  I think George Walker Bush, and his policies, may be the best bet to end humanity before we spread beyound this planet. ( urlLink via )
