urlLink Kissinger's Commission  Kissinger: I'd like to welcome all of you to the first meeting of our independent commission. Look around. You are here because you're the top 1 percent of all public servants. You're the elite, the best of the best. You have integrity and vision. Impeccable judgment. You are Christian, and  with one exception  white. I chose each of you myself, because I know that you are much like me. I know that together we will form an impartial, non-partisan dream team and get to the bottom of 9/11.
