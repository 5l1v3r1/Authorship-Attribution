"Your papers, please."  "Uh. I only have a pipe, man."    urlLink "Zen you'd bitter come vit me..."  ( urlLink via )  I believe authoritarians are manufacturing and manipulating public fears about drug use in order to create a police state where a much broader agenda of social control can be implemented, using government power to determine what movies we may watch, determine who we may love and how we may love them, determine whether we may or must pray to a deity. I believe the war on drug users masks a war on democracy. -Richard Lawrence Miller
