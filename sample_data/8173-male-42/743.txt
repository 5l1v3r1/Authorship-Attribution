urlLink Mulder, Where Are You?  Now, instead of an inept Bureau with a powerful pop-culture doppelgnger, we've got FBI-friendly TV shows masking an increasingly powerful, but otherwise unreformed, Bureau. The thick irony would be amusing if it weren't so real. Fear of increased FBI activity is probably just as paranoid as it was when "The X-Files" began, but all the same, it would be nice if Mulder and Scully had waited a few years before going after the black helicopters.
