urlLink The Temptation of Dr. Weed  Dr. David Sands was one of the worlds few experts on mycoherbicidesfungi that kill other living plants. His specialty was a fungus meant to replace toxic chemicals as the weapon of choice in a drug war battle plan designed to decimate crops of coca and cannabis in the jungles of Colombia.  ...members of Congress are pushing to reactivate research on mycoherbicides. Alarms have already been raised by activists who hate the idea of American imperialists running the show in Colombia, and by environmentalists who fear that the Bush administration will dump Sands mycoherbicides on a swath of South American rainforest the size of California without full awareness of the potential dangers.  Sands is adamant that the project is dead.
