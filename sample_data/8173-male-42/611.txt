Yes, the links on all the recent posts are fubar-ed. Its a redesign thing. In other words... I meant to do that.  Oh hell, it'll all come out in the wash.  What did I miss while I was out scavenging computer parts from the wasteland?  From  urlLink American Samizdat  -   urlLink If The Shoe Were On The Other Foot  Suppose that some time in late 2000, Russian and Chinese leaders, with the covert support of some other national leaders, were convinced that the US election results had been materially altered by a small right-wing clique, and that as a result the US was in fact no longer a democracy, and its weapons of mass destruction, now apparently in the hands of an unelected, psychopathic and illegitimate group of radical religious extremists, posed an imminent threat to world peace.   And suppose that as a consequence Russian and Chinese forces were sent to quickly and decisively intervene to bring about 'regime change' in the US and return the country to stability.   urlLink Operation Northwoods  "The whole point of a democracy is to have leaders responding to the public will, and here this is the complete reverse, the military trying to trick the American people into a war that they want but that nobody else wants."  From  urlLink Stare  -   urlLink Invasion Of The Doll People  Keels book was indeed prophetic; the new control system emerged as Mass Media, which is essentially a doll culture. Our media personalities behave much like those observed entities. More than 30 years later, we now know what Keels idea of reprogramming really aimed to do to destroy the OFF switch.  We are all Americans now, whether we like it or not.   urlLink Woman Who Filed Sex Suit Against Bush Dead  It's another weird tragedy surrounding the Bush administration - and this one has received NO mention from the media.   urlLink     From  urlLink The Hive  -    urlLink The Zen of CounterInsurgency: Pt. 1  Quoted this week in NewsMax.com, General Tommy Franks issued baldly that the U.S. Constitution will probably need to be scrapped, in favor of some form of military dictatorship. Citing the blanket-spectre of "terrorist threats," he reasoned that the U.S. would need to come under lockdown and Total Control via the U.S. military...for our own good.   And just like that, General Franks sets the stage for a Second American Revolution.
