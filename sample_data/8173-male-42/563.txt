urlLink Where Are You, Beloved General?  As one of the first Western journalists allowed in since North Korea's latest nuclear crisis with the United States began last fall, I experience first-hand the paranoia that marks everyday life for North Koreans. For seven days I am watched, followed and fed propaganda. From doctors to parsons, everyone I am introduced to -- and I have no choice about whom I meet -- parrots the same line: hatred of the Americans, matched only by their love of the "Great Leader," Kim Jong Il.
