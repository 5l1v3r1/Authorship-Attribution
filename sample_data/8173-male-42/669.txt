urlLink The Children's Story  The play praises patriotism, but the judges only saw teens cutting up an American flag.  "For 10 years it's been clear that these flag desecration statutes are unconstitutional.

( urlLink via )   urlLink The Chidren's Story  A lot of [people] have referred to this book as being against the backdrop of the Cold War, but the sad thing is that since the end of the Cold War, the warnings of this book have become MORE and not less pertinent, (indeed, now say something stupid) as the hard left have used the ruse that Communism has collapsed to inject their values into all of us, like a bacillus, through the back door. (BWAHAHAHAHA!)  (Seems to be a novel that brings out the idiot in some people. You know who you are.)
