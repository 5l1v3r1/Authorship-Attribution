urlLink FEMA Preparing for Mass Destruction  ...the federal agency charged with disaster preparedness, is engaged in a crash effort to prepare for multiple mass destruction attacks on U.S. cities - including the creation of sprawling temporary cities to handle millions of displaced persons.  Ominously, FEMA has been given a deadline of having the cities ready to go by January 2003  in about six months.   A source familiar with the deadline believes the effort is related to making the U.S. prepared for counterattacks if the U.S. invades Iraq sometime next year.
