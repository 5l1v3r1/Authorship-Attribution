urlLink Be alert, don't be paranoid...    urlLink Is America doomed?  I admit that even considering the idea of a bomb shelter, of "duct tape and plastic and three days of food." makes me feel like some kind of survivalist wacko. Next thing I know, I'll move to Idaho, start wearing camouflage and carrying automatic rifle...   urlLink "I don't want to get off on a rant here, but ..."  Am I the only person who is sick and tired of how our society has become so paranoid over what might happen, instead of what is real? We've become a nation of Chicken Littles, running around preaching doom and gloom to anyone who will listen. And even when our worst fears don't come to fruition, we don't learn anything from it. The very next time Chicken Little starts screaming about the falling sky, we run right out to buy more umbrellas.
