urlLink Real Live Preacher  When told the Noah and the Ark story in Sunday School, I quickly figured out that two of every kind of animal would not fit on one boat. No one else seemed to be doing the math. I could no more believe the ark story than I could believe the sky was green. I wanted to believe. Believing seemed nice, but I couldnt. I COULD NOT.   I felt strange and out of place because everyone else at church seemed to believe everything.    I kept my believing problem to myself because I thought something was wrong with me. ( urlLink via )
