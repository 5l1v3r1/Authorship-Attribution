urlLink Government intelligence a misnomer  If you want to understand the very real threat to our rights of free speech and free association, Jimmy Wynn is your man.  Wynn is commanding officer of the Militia of Georgia, a small paramilitary group that believes we are "governed by petty despots and tyrants" who have robbed us of our constitutional rights. Despite that heated rhetoric, however, no available evidence suggests that Wynn has ever advocated violence against the government or law enforcement. He's just an American with an odd point of view.
