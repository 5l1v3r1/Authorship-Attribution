urlLink Congresswoman's words stricken from House record  "I come from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat. We need to make sure it doesn't happen again. Over and over again after the election when you stole the election, you came back here and said, 'Get over it.' No, we're not going to get over it. And we want verification from the world."        --Rep. Corrine Brown (D-FL)
