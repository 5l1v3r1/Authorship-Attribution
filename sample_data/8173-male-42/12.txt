urlLink The Hollow Earth  There is really no North or South Pole. ...there are really wide openings to the hollow interior of the Earth.  Flying saucers come from the hollow interior of the Earth through these polar openings.  There is a large population inhabiting the inner concave surface of the Earth's crust, composing a civilization far in advance of our own... Flying saucers are only one of their many achievements.  The existence of a polar opening and land beyond the Poles... is probably a top international secret.
