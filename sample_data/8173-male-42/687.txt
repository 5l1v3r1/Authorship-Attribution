urlLink War of the Words: Scientist Attacks Alien Claims  Astronomer Philip Plait is tired of radio personality Richard Hoagland's claims. He's had enough of Hoagland's assertions that NASA is covering up evidence of extraterrestrial life, that the infamous Face on Mars was built by sentient aliens and, of late, that otherworldly machine parts are embedded in the red planet's dirt.  "I've let this fester long enough," Plait wrote recently. "This kind of pseudoscience is like a virus. At low levels, it's no big deal, but when it reaches a certain threshold it becomes sickening."   urlLink Nasa Running Scared: Shooting the Messenger  A messenger is under attack.  The message is being hidden.   The message is, life has existed and may still exist beyond the earth.  We know this now from scientific observation and the study of the data returned from both manned and unmanned missions into near-Earth space, to the moon and to the planets of our home solar system.  This Hoagland Debunking Campaign should be seen, not as being a personal attack upon Hoagland, but as being a tactic in implementing the  urlLink Brookings Report  and keeping the official lid on the ET/life off Earth discoveries.
