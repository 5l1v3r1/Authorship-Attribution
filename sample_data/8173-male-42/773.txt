urlLink Forked tongues  Under the skin of your nearest and dearest politician is a reptilian layer, a sea of scales, shifty eyes and a horny tail. So said David Icke...   ...the joke is on us. Politicians, we say, are a different breed: a species apart, not like us, inhuman. The result is a damaged democracy, and a level of political debate better suited to the playground...  ...I have a radical proposition. If we are angry at our politicians, if they seem disconnected from the public or appear to be following the wrong track, maybe that is because they are mistaken or have different beliefs to ours. Either that, or they are lizards. Now which one seems more likely?
