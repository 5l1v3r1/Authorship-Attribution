urlLink Welcome to Brainwashington D.C.  A friend of mine coined the term 'Brainwashington' after watching the media-coverage in the wake of the 9-11 terror attacks on New York and Washington. A joke at first, but now, nearly 2 years after these attacks, and after investigating and writing on this case since Sep 12th - I have to admit: it's quite serious. I think we all have become witnesses and victims of the biggest brainwashing operation in history. ( urlLink via )
