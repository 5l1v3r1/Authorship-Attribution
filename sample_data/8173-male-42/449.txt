urlLink Country fucks agree: Bush more popular than Jesus  Some country music stations in Texas and other parts of the country stopped playing Dixie Chicks music after lead singer Natalie Maines criticized President Bush and possible war against Iraq.   Maines told a London audience Monday, "Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas."  Can you tell I hate country music? Can you tell I hate people who listen to country music? But I may have to buy a Dixie Chicks CD or two now... Maybe I'm missing out on something.
