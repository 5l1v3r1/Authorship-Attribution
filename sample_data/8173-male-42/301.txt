urlLink David Icke does not exist  In Icke's alternative vision of reality, the planet is ruled by bloodline conspiracies in which the Queen, George Bush, Tony Blair, Hillary Clinton, Kris Kristofferson and others, are really multi-dimensional shape-shifting reptilian entities who practise secret paedophilic satanic rituals.  This is not fiction; this, he says, is really happening, and who can really be sure of anything? If you follow Icke's logic we're all mind-controlled and indoctrinated from birth anyway, we are all 'children of the Matrix'.
