urlLink The Third Rush  Nazi researchers used concentration camp inmates to test a cocaine-based "wonder drug" they hoped would enhance the performance of German troops. It was hoped the drug would give soldiers almost unlimited fighting powers at a time when the German armies were in retreat.   urlLink Military looks to drugs for battle readiness  What's called for, according to DARPA, is a "radical approach" to achieve "continuous assisted performance" for up to seven days. This would actually involve much more than the "linear, incremental and ... limited" approaches of stimulants like caffeine and amphetamines.  This 'better warrior through chemistry' field is being looked at very closely. It's part of the research going on that is very aggressive and wide open.   urlLink U.S. Moves Into Bioweapon Era  ...far more advanced means of enhancing performance are being studied by the U.S. Special Operations Command, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and other Defense Department organizations. One example is quarter-sized body "monitors" that can be implanted under the skin of a soldier's neck and used to trigger the release of chemicals for "body regulation" and the release of "rejuvenating drugs."
