urlLink Howard Dean Must Die (an endorsement)  If he gets the nomination, and there's enough media attention to prevent vote-rigging, I think they're going to kill him.  Then we'll have a revolution. Not the kind of revolution with ten million people rioting in the streets, because of course they'll make it look like an accident or "terrorism," but how about the kind of revolution where a hundred million people feel like they've been punched in the gut, like the world has been pulled out from under them, like that's the last time they ever waste their infinite strength in a system designed to suck it down the toilet.  A Dean assassination could do for leftward motion (or saneward motion) what the 9/11 psychological operation did for rightward motion, or what the JFK assassination did for leftward motion.   ...or not. - mutant
