urlLink The Vomitus Maximus Museum  In stead of creating art I eat luxury garbage and swill expensive wine so I can black out and forget how miserable and small I have allowed myself to become. Im lost in a thousand radioactive strip malls which glow piss yellow in the dark. Dirty brown cyclones of carbon monoxide and human feces swirl litter in parking lots. Im covered with the shit and dead skin of Hollywood.
