urlLink The "peace movement" is an Invention of Freemason Satanists  The "peace movement" is a fraud. The Grateful Dead, the Merry Pranksters, and many (most) others in the entertainment industry are freemason satanists. The "peace movement" of the 60s was a totally orchestrated mind control operation of freemason change agents. There is very little doubt in my mind that indymedia is also a product of spoiled brats of very wealthy freemason families.
