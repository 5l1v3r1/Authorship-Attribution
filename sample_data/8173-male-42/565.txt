urlLink Alabamians fear chemical disaster  In Anniston and the cities and towns nearby, people talk a lot about "the plume"  an accidentally released toxic cloud  and how fast it might move over their homes and schools. The mood hovers between paranoia and imminent panic, giving the city the pending doom feel of an old Twilight Zone episode.  In an eerie preview of what life might be like in a future chemical attack by terrorists, people who live within 6 miles of the incinerator have been issued protective plastic hoods, portable air filters, duct tape and plastic and told to prepare a "safe room" in their homes.
