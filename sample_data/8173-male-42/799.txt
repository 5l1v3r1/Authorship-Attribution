urlLink Why I Voted For George Bush  So when he saw me, an obvious troublemaker in a BUSH-NORIEGA T-shirt, he blew his Ivy League cool. Maybe for the only time in his life. But he blew it.  "You bastards never give up, do you?"  He then delivered a swift, solid kick to my shin.  You read that correctly. George Bush, the forty-first President of the United States, kicked me! And then he was gone, his limo pulling away before I could grasp what had happened.   urlLink The single greatest event of my life  His smile faded, and he raised his left arm in our direction. And then, George W. Bush, the 43rd president of the United States of America, extended his middle finger.  Read that last sentence again. I got flipped off by George W. Bush.
