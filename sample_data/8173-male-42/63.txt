Internet Explorer View Source This is just a note cast adrift on the great search engine sea, a message to those like myself, whose Windows ME System Restore has cratered some useful functions in Internet Explorer, such as View Source on the right-click menu. After a System Restore to repair some other troubles, I found that when I used the View Source command would not function, wouldn't do anything for that matter. So I searched for a fix...  Search = internet explorer windows me notepad view source won't work registry ...and variations on that theme.  Microsoft Support, you may as well ask your cat what the hell is wrong with your computer. They recommend that you clear your temporary internet files to fix the trouble. If that works for you, whoop-de-fucking-do. Other search results will get you message boards filled with users asking the same question, but they never get an answer that has anything to do with the price of tea in China.  Here is the answer... dammit. Edit your registry by running regedit, see that the following exists, it probably does not and so you must add it. Editing your registry is tricky. So if you screw up your registry, I take NO responsibility. You may want to make a backup first.  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE  |- Software  |- Microsoft  |- Internet Explorer  |- View Source Editor  |- Editor Name       (Default) = C:\windows\notepad.exe  Thats it. The answer comes by way of  urlLink Vim Online , which is the only free vi type editor for Windows that I have ever found, complex, but useful if you need to edit cgi on a Windows desktop and don't have a shell account with vi available.  Thus endeth my good deed for today.
