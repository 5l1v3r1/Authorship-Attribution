urlLink Post-9/11 Hollywood: The Films They Dare Not Make Today  Try pitching this to a studio today:  The movie ends with the hero blowing up a skyscraper. No, better than that. A whole skyline full of skyscrapers! (Yes, in an American city.) See, the hero's this terrorist, but he finds true love at the end. The film's got romance. And in the final scene the terrorist hero and his lady love stand in romantic silhouette before a panoramic view of an entire city skyline majestically aglow from the explosions, then come crumbling down.
