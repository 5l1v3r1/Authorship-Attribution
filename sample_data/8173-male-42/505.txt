urlLink The view from Wonderland  Are the people who are caught up in a mass delusion ever aware that they are living in a malignant fantasyland?   When society has gone mad, does the "conventional belief" somehow "feel different" to those within the society? The question virtually answers itself and history confirms that when reason departs and collective insanity takes over, it all seems "perfectly sensible" from the inside.  In the present crisis that has befallen our republic, there is still access to relevant information and there is an abundance of fallacy in "the official version" to be exposed, so that those of us with eyes to see, ears to hear, and the ordinary smarts to think it over, are quite able to come up with a reasonable assessment of our peril, and of our most prudent means to deal with it.
