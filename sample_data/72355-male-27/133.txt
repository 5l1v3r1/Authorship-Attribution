Ok, so  urlLink These People  are goddamned weird. It's a circus, like a real travelling circus, and about half of them are a band. The band plays, well, circus music. Only not. It's kinda hard to describe, I mean, they play classic circus music, but with these bizarre lyrics and stuff, and I just don't know what else to say except go there.
