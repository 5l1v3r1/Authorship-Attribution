In reference to  urlLink yon post , I guess 3 participants doesn't actually constitute an orgy.   word of the moment:   urlLink menage a trois  - obviously. This is three people, fucking one another, in unison. The actual definiton differs somewhat from what every single living human being considers a menage a trois, but to hell with every single living human being - what do they know?   bonus word:   urlLink orgy  - which, of course, is much like the previous in that every single living human being that doesn't study ancient greece thinks it means "lots of people fucking in a big room", even though the original meaning is somewhat different. But like I said - to hell with every single living human being.
