Freaky link   Like,  urlLink Yikes.  I don't know what the hell is going on there. I'm really weirded out. I bought a bed, tho... Turns out I don't have a queen. I have a full. So I go to the bed store, buy a full size mattress, get it home, realize it's the same size as my old bed, smack my forehead and say DOH! real loud, then go back to the mattress store and trade it in for a twin. then I go to walmart and use the difference to buy a sheet set and a new pillow. One thing: Bedclothes for twin beds are fucking cheap. I spent like 15 bucks on a sheet set and a pillow. the same stuff for a queen size would be 25-30... I'm starting to like this little bed. I don't have a box spring, tho, so I'll have to get that, and a frame, with my next paycheck.
