Damn. I missed Firday the 13th. in october, no less. Oh well. I did find a really odd link or 3.  urlLink Somebody hanged an elephant in 1916 for killing a man.   urlLink The Flat Earth Society  After reading the FAQ's, I can only hope this is a joke. I know there are some flat earthers left, but I would hope they'd be smart enough (both of them) to provide actual data instead of saying the earth rides on a turtle's shell, or there are green-skinned women hanging off the edge of the earth.  urlLink  A fairly cool webpage created by someone with an odd sense of humor.   urlLink The ten coolest video game shirts   urlLink I love bacon  A collection of random funny and bizarre stuff.  urlLink The VisionStation  Monitors are soooo 20th century.  urlLink Bored.com  4 pantloads of links to just about everywhere.
