Did I really just go on a "Kids These Days" diatribe - about video games? What a weird time to grow old. Sonny, back in my day, bikes didn't have suspension, candy bars cost 50 cents, and video games were goddamned hard! and heavily pixelated, too - we didn't have no 16X full screen adaptive anti-aliasing at 1600X1200@245fps. Our games were blocky, in 16 colors, and slow. And we were glad to have them! Mario Bros 3 was a technological wonder, damnit! (shakes cane)
