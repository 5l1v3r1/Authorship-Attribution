Oh wait - that's just my ointment.  So I just watched spider-man 2. Well, I watched spiderman 2, but I'm still using the hyphen so fuck you. I had read that spider(hyphen)man 2 was a pretty good fucken movie, so I Piratized&copy; it - and yes, Spider(hyphen)Man 2 is a really good fucken movie. Especially the part where venom kills Mary Jane. Oops. Spoiler alert. You shouldn't have read that part if you haven't seen the movie yet. Since I'm on the subject of spoilers - You probably shouldn't go to  urlLink Moviepooper.com  if you haven't seen every movie ever made.   current music:  "more human that human (meet bambi in the king's harem mix)" by white zombie. It's a badass remix of a badass song, which makes me also a badass.
