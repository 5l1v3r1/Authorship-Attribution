I'M FULL OF TINIER MEN!    Serioiusly. I am.   current music:  Well, it was "hungry hungry hippos" by anal cunt, which is this fucking bizarre thrash cover of, you guessed it, the hungry hungry hippos song, but that song is 18 seconds long, and "Ccec" by autechre came on after that. Autechre (probably pronounced Aw-teck-er, but this is a subject of some debate) are fucking genius. "Ccec" is a strange song, lots of odd disjointed beats and samples, with the main instrument being a rapper's voice, chopped up into unrecognizable segments, and apparently randomized. they make some of the most cerebral techno I've heard. you can't just sit back and let autechre play in the background, you have to take it in, intently listen to it. You really oughta at least treat yourself to the mp3's of their "peel sessions" stuff. I bought both the peel sessions cd's.
