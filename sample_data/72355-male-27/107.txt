It was THIIIIIIIIIIIIS Big    So, I'm out taking pictures today, and I come across  urlLink This.  I want. it's a 1969 International Travelall 1200. Essntially, this behemoth is a Scout, with the Travelall package from a company that worked with International. The Travelall package is mostly body stuff, but Stageway coachbuilders took it and made it into a freakshow. It's for sale, for 2500 bucks, and tomorrow I'ma go try to get it. Yay. I'll post here either way. That thing, by the way, has 5 bench seats, with room enough in the back area for 2 more. It's a biggun.
