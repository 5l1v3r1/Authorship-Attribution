I'm nearly horizontal!  that is all.   current music:  Uh, "come to daddy" by aphex twin, which I think I've listed here before. lemme go check...hmm. seems not. Although I have mentioned the song before, because it is a fucking great song. I listened to this acoustic live version of "symphony of destruction" by megadeth before that. Acoustic megadeth - now there's some weird shit.
