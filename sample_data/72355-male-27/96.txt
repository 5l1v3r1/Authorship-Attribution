It's the real thing   Coca-Cola comes in: 8 oz cans, 12 oz cans, 10 oz bottles, 12 oz bottles, 17.5 oz bottles, 20 oz bottles, 1 liter bottles, 2 liter bottles, and 3 liter bottles, with multipacks of 6, 12, 24, and 6 17.5 oz bottles. and I bet you can still get the 16 oz bottles... And don't forget the fountain. Man, they need to calm down. I just drank one of those 8 oz cans, and all I gotta say is "why?" It's nearly half of a 12 oz can, and costs more, due to the low volume nature of it. Nevermind, I'm too tired to make any sense.
