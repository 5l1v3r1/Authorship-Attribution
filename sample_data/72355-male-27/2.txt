I am Tiger Woods. And I'm not even too sure who Tiger Woods is. I am Tiger Woods&copy; wearing Michael Jordan&copy; cologne and Nike&copy; sneakers in my Buick&copy; listening to the Britney Spears&copy; cd I got from McDonalds&copy;. Did domebody say McDonalds&copy;? uh, Yeah, I just did. Anyway, I got the cd for only 2.99 when I got a Big Mac&copy; after I saw the commercial on NBC&copy; that came on during the Olympics&copy;, which took place in Australia&copy;.  Oh yeah, Mir isn't gonna be scrapped after all. Turns out, somebody raised enough money to buy all that space-lysol, and they won't send Mir spiraling into the earth in february. The space-fungus was unavailable for comment. Somebody needs to make a movie about the heroic space-lysol. SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE LYYYYYYYYSOOOOOLLLLLLLLL  IN THE 21ST CENTURY!!!!!!!!
