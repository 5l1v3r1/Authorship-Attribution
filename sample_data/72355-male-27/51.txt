So, I noticed a while back that Menudo (the eternal boy band) changed their name to mdo. I can only assume that someone finally told them what menudo is... "So Menudo is getting ready to record another album, and-" "uh, hey man - I need to tell you something about the name of the band...(whispering)" "....uh huh.....yeah.....they make it out of tripe?!?!?!?!"
