I've noticed a few things during my time online: 1: You should not name your band after anything that might turn up sex sites on a search engine. Case in point - Orgy. 2: Some things just don't need web pages.  urlLink Case in point.  3: Nobody cares how many awards your website won from your friend wheo runs an awards website, but everybody still proudly displays their awards. 4: Some people just don't care about older browsers. I have decided to be "Browser Hostile" in that I am ignoring 2.0 browsers, but at least remember that not everyone uses IE 5.5 or the latest NS6 beta.  5: searching for just about anything will turn up a few porn pages. searching for "sex", however, doesn't return as many as you'd think.   Has anybody else noticed that Britney Spears is an obsessive-compulsive? look at her song titles: "Hit me baby, one more time - Oops, I did it again - (I can't get no) satisfaction"..... She has a real repetition thing going on. Maybe she's just a slut.
