urlLink Slashdot  has a poll up: favorite meat. and I saw a couple funny funny funny lines in the comments.  ATTN: VEGETARIANS - CALM DOWN, THEY'RE JOKES.  "I love vegetarians. Some of my favorite foods are vegetarians." "Plants aren't food - food  eats  plants!"  Also, "Cows would have a much longer life expectancy if they weren't made out of beef and leather" I voted beef, but only because there wasn't an "all of the above" option.   current music:  the Primus cover of "have a cigar", which is one of my favorite ping floyd songs.
