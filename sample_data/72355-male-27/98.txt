Quick link    urlLink THESE THINGS  kick ass. It's a radio controlled car, about the size of a standard hot-wheels. Seriously tiny. And it's full-function, meaning you can go foreward and backward, and turn left and right while going foreward or backward. it takes like 45 seconds for mine to charge, and I can run it for 5-10 minutes. I've driven mine around on a table at the booth in the restaurant I was at. I drove it on my desk, and I mean actually drove it around, like around obstacles and stuff. it's tiny, manuverable, and cheap (mine was less than 20 bucks), and oh yeah, you can mod the hell out of them. the link I gave you links to pages where people added a 2nd battery, custom wheels, new bodies, all kinds of things. Check it out.
