I had to switch to all-cotton pillows because I kept melting the polyester ones.  "No E-mail, only hot dog." -sony commercial. "Psst! It's me - Death. I'll see you soon, OK? I know you can't hear me, but try to feel what I'm about to say, deep down in your soul - Don't eat the gazpachooo."                                       -Manny Calavera, "Grim Fandango"
