Black Gold     So I never liked beer, but for some reason, I really like Stout. wait - I like STOUT. STOUT kinda kicks you in the mouth. tastes like burnt chocolate and nuts.   urlLink Guinness  makes the best and most popular STOUT, but this leads me to a question: What the hell is it with liquor/beer companies having webpages loaded with flash and music?  urlLink Stolichnaya ,  urlLink beefeater ,  urlLink Kahlua ,  urlLink Budweiser ... you get the picture.
