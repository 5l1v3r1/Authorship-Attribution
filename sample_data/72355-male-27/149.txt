There, I said it. Not much else to discuss, I guess.   word of the moment:   urlLink schlock  - as in the elvis impersonation and james brown dance a certain orange cgi cat did in a certain worst movie ever to sully a movie screen.   current music:  It's "Garfield is the worst movie ever" by the catbeaters.  Good lord that movie sucks.  In other news -  urlLink I guess the banana worked.
