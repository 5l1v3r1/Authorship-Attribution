Wanted   Wanted: One brave American willing to hijack a plane in afghanistan, while the plane is full of afghan people, and crash it into something important in afghanistan. the trouble will be finding in afghanistan worth crashing a plane into. I always wondered why we named our warm fluffy afghans after such a crappy hot worthless wasteland in the middle of nowhere. At least they don't keep attacking my ottoman. Stupid mongol hordes.
