IS THERE PORNOGRAPHY ON YOUR COMPUTER?    Yes. now leave me alone. I am really starting to despise these spams and popups telling me how  every  computer saves  every  picture from  every  website I visit. I can empty my own damn cache, and I can clear my own damned temp files. And besides, I  know  there is pornography on my computer, because I put it there. I explicitly searched out and saved hot sweaty teen anal asian britney spears lesbian alanis morrisette teen naked boob boobs breast sex teen lesbian buick sex teen files onto my computer, and I intend to keep them. On the same note, why do they only concentrate on porn? What if I was visiting sites detailing how to build a large explosive device with which I would assassinate my local authority figure? What if I was visiting sites about how to make the perfect souffle, and I didn't want my football playing roomate to see, lest he pound me into a pinkish paste? Eh. Eh, the official statement of the apathetic. That's me: A Shining Model of Apathy. I care a lot, I really really do.
