A few posts back I said I didn't think "fop" meant anything. It does. I remembered, I own this really crappy dictionary, and it includes fop as part of a 3-way orgy of reciprocal definitions. A Fop is a dude or a dandy, a dude is a fop, and a dandy is a dude, or a fop. Clears that up. This is the same dictionary that had simile, but not metaphor. Yeah.   word of the moment:   urlLink fop  - I mean, what else would it be in this post? Dictionary.com does a hell of a lot better job at explaining what a fop is. And I was right - it is a bad thing.
