So, Here is the first entry into my  Blogger  powered pseudo-journal. wait - meta-journal. no... um... "Journalesque Stream Of Thought." (Journalesque Stream Of Thought &copy; 1972 eclipse studios) So, if this works, I shall have a place on my website which I can use to post random thoughts that wouldn't quite fit into anything else. I already have a section for this (core), but that is more for structured rants and such. At this point in time I would like to say "Eugene" 4 times: Eugene Eugene Eugene Eugene. I would also like to state that Escargot is a really bad name for snails. They should be labeled "Snails" in bold print. just to let you know, so you don't order them while trying to show off for a date or something ("Ah kin reed fraynch, gimme one of them thar escargots"). The menu should say in large text just above the name of the dish: "NOTICE: There are snails in this dish. If you order it, you will be expected to eat multiple snails"
