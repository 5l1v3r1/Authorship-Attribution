Have you ever noticed how those "gangsta" rappers will have 125,000 dollar platinum and diamond teeth, a 200,000 dollar necklace, a few bracelets worth 40 grand per, a half million dollar car (usually several), a gigantic house worth more than every house you've ever lived in combined, and wear a 3 dollar t-shirt? Why wear a Rolex, Fubu pants, and a hanes t you got in a plastic package with two other ones just like it? All I know is that if I ever spend 125 grand on my teeth, those suckers are gonna drive my car or something.  urlLink Heavy  Spend the rest of your life here.
