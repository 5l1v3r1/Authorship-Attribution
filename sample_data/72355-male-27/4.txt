The Mir Spacestation is getting a lot of press of late. Apparently, there is some nasty space-fungus eating the plastic on the old rustbucket. If MirCorp (the company that is in control of Mir) doesn't get 7-10 million dollars (presumably to buy lots and lots of lysol.) within a few weeks, they will have to scrap Mir next February. another problem: NBC is going to have to think up something quick, because they had a new survivor-esque series in the works, wherein the winner gets to go to Mir. Fat chance of getting on Mir if it's destined to crash into the Earth. now, on top of all that - James "I directed Titanic, and you?" Cameron is actually going to be going to Mir to spend some time. I assume he is trying to get ideas for a new movie, since he went on a sub and saw THE Titanic, and then shortly thereafter made that movie "Bismarck", or something to that effect.  urlLink RANDOM "I WANNA BE LIKE MARTHA STEWART" LINK  (Random "I wanna be like Martha Stewart &copy;1987 eclipse studios)  urlLink RANDOM COOL MUSIC LINK  (Random cool music link &copy;1849 eclipse studios)  urlLink RANDOM UNCOOL MUSIC LINK  (Random uncool music link &copy;1850 eclipse stu-stu-studios) On another note: "Space-Fungus" would be a really cool name for a band. Ditto for "I wanna be like Martha Stewart". maybe a ska band could use that second one....
