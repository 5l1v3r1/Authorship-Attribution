The news of my death has been pretty much spot on.   I am posting from the great state of Illinois. whee. I live in Spauldo's basement, which is cool. Not really a whole lot to say, really, except that I think you should go check out  urlLink Homestar Runner  Strong Bad is cool.     Current Music:  "House of the rising sun", only it's the live version by oysterhead. Oysterhead being les from primus and the guy from phish.   Stuck in my head:  "Jacking for beats" by Ice Cube, of all things... I remember liking the video, tho.
