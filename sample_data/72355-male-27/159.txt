The past couple of posts have been made with a program called "hello", by picasa software, who I can't be bothered to go find and link to right now. Basically it's an instant messenger that allows you to upload pics to a server for purposes of blogging. It has other purposes, I'm sure - but I don't care.   word of the moment:   urlLink syzygy  - It's the first WOTM that I didn't know the meaning of to begin with. syzygy is when the sun, moon, and earth all line up. It's also the shortest word in the english language where Y appears 3 times. and It's a bot in Unreal Tournament 2003. The pronunciation key looks like  urlLink cuneiform , but you say "siss-i-gee" with the I being pronounced like in fish.
