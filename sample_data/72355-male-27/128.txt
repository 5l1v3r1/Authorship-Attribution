So I just went to blogger.com to maybe post or something, since various parts of the net are being real slow for some reason, and I noticed they had the radio shack motto on the front page. Google (company motto: yeah, we misspelled googol, so sue us.) bought blogger, and there is a F.A.Q. explaining what it means to us, the end-users. The link to the F.A.Q. is "You've got questions, we've got answers.". I read this and went "Neat!" because I parody that all the time (Radio Smack: You've got questions, we've got a hot cup of shut the fuck up). Anyway, I just thought it was neat is all.   current music:  "Why does it hurt when I pee?" by Frank Zappa. Frank Zappa is (well, was) and odd motherfucker. And coming from me that means a lot.
