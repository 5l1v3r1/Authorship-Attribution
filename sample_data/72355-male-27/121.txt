Lord Of The Rings :The Two Towers is a pretty freakin' good movie. But. The first one (which, when acronym-ized into LOTR:FOTR, looks silly) had one "joke" at Gimli, the dwarf's expense. It was when Mr. big strong full height man chucked his stubby ass across a chasm, Gimli got all huffy and said "never toss a dwarf.". yeah, haha, really funny, let's get back to the uruk-hai, shall we?  Anyway, that one dwarf joke excuses the dwarf "in" joke this time around, when Gimli asks Mr full height to toss him across another chasm so he can whup on the aformentioned uruk-hai. "toss me" says Gimli, regretting it before he even said it. That joke is fine, because it's a mildly funny reference to the mildly funny joke in the first movie. I'd let the movie have one more dwarf joke, that they're allowed. But no, there were something like FOUR HUNDRED more dwarf jokes. I might have missed some of the 'DWARVS ARR SHORT" grafiti scrawled on an orc's helmet or something, but there are still FAR TOO MANY DWARF JOKES IN THE NEW LORD OF THE RINGS MOVIE. At this rate, the next movie will be titled "Lord Of The Rings : Gimli Is A Short Dwarf  And He's Short Ha Ha" I mean, Come now. How many times can you be funny making fun of short people? Like 7 times, that's how many. beyond that, you risk getting sued by The Altitude-Challenged Americans Network or something. There is one dwarf joke that isn't about them being short. It's about how dwarf women (also short) have beards, and can't be distinguished from the males, and are really ugly, but you'll never see them anyway, because they are barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen, where all women, and especially short ones, belong. Seriously, I don't see how they avoided being sued over that crap. It's not even funny. I am, by the way, not a dwarf. I'm 5' 8". So I'm not like, lashing out or anything.   current music:   "Creepy Crawl" by Superjoint Ritual, which is one of like 40 side projects of Phil Anselmo, lead singer of Pantera.
