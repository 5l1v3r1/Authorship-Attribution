That's my car!  urlLink I think I may have found myself a monitor.  BTW, check out the rest of the stuff on that site - like the whole wall projection monitor, so when Klesk or Dessloch shoves a rocket up your ass - you will fear the rocket. (OBSCURE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER REFERENCES &COPY;1992 ECLIPSE STUDIOS) Oooooooohhhhh.... I just had an epiphany. Or maybe I hit my head. Either way, I just thought up a very cool game: Unreal vs. Quake. Think about it - Xaero fires off a volley from the BFG while dodging a 5 rocket spread from Xan Kriegor on the highest building in the Morpheus map, only to catch a sniper's bullet in the head - which was fired by Drimacus. It'd be interesting to restrict the Quake chars. to Quake weapons, and vice versa. Would a Quaker survive against a skilled UT player with an eightball or a flak cannon? Can a UT player with a ripper defend the flag against a plasma rifle toting Quaker? And who would win in a headshot contest between a Quaker with a railgun and a UT'er with a sniper rifle? and what about the almighty Redeemer? what does a Quaker have to stop a guided mini-nuke that can chase them around a corner? Of course, this has been argued since Unreal came out to compete with Quake 2, but I don't think anyone has actually attempted a mod to decide. Then there are the copyright issues. Making a BFG and a Daemia or a Uriel to carry it in UT would probably upset the brass at Id. Oh well. I'm done spewing my head wound inspired idea.
