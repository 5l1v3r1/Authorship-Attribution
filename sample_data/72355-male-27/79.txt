I'll kill you all!!!!   Go to  urlLink My Normal Site.  I've been doing this weblog for upwards of a year, and I only just now built a whole page to wrap around it. actually, I built like 5 pages. I've gone and made a clearinghouse of all my random webpage ideas. every once in a while, I'll think up some random page, and build it. but I have no content to put up on these pages - I just think up the basic look and feel of it. So I went and made my page a starting point to go look at all my other pages. I also built a page called ++caffeine+based+life+form++, which is kind of a weblog, too. odd, huh?
