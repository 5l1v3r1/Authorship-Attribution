Apologies are in order.   A couple posts back I incorectly identified the United States Postal Fucking Service as the United States Fucking Postal Service. I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused, and I apologize to the United States Fucking Postal Service Pizzaria in Tampa, Florida for the extra mail and phone calls I have caused you.  And now, I would like to sing a little song for you:  Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? Spongebob Squarepants! Absorbent and yellow and porous is he. Spongebob Squarepants!
