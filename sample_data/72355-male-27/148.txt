Testing, testing, one two three... testing comments. whee. This is to test the comments, which I just now turned on. Please feel free to comment on any and all posts I make in here. I'd especially love it if you point out my spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and false assumptions - that's what the internet is for, after all. Actually, I would really appreciate comments on any past post you find interesting, funny, offensive - whatever. I crave the attention. Of course, if you have mastery of time travel, feel free to comment on future posts as well.
