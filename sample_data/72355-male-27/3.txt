Trust me - I checked an awful lot to make sure I felt like less of a man than I should. What I'm trying to say is, I've never seen "First Blood" all the way thru. In fact, I think the only Stallone movie I have seen all the way thru was Demolition man. I think I am less of a man because of this, and I need to get tough and go rent all 17 rocky movies and watch them straight thru. Or I could go look at flowers. No. Flowers are the wrong thing. I could...... Step on some flowers. No. Uhhhh...... well. I could always be an alchoholic womanizer with a beer gut and 5 o'clock shadow all the time... I'd be a real man then. Of course, I could just have some deep seated psychological problem with Stallone. Yeah, maybe I saw Sly naked when I was a kid or something and it scarred me for life, and now I can't see him in a movie without getting the urge to change the channel. But then again, I might just not like any of his movies. Sylvester Stallone, if you read this, Lemme know if you used to expose yourself to little boys, then my questions will all be answered. well, that one will be. the one about having grilled cheese sandwiches with the lead singer of INXS on a spaceship will have to wait.
