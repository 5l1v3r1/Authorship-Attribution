Random Goodie Mobb Quote "Who's that peekin' in my window? pow! Nobody now." It's good to be random. Chaos is the root of all evyl. note, that I spelled "evil" wrong, I did that because I wanted you to pronounce it like "EEEEEEEVYLLLLL", like Hedley Lamar on Blazing Saddles. Also note that evyl is cool. If evyl is cool, then Chaos also is cool.
