Everything I know, I learned by killing smart people and eating their brains  hey, go listen to "mope" by the bloodhound gang. following is my favorite part of the song. (my favorite part of any song so far):  (song stops) Pac-Man: "yo yo yo yo yo! What it is motherfuckers?" band: "Aw shit, here comes Pac-Man." "Hey Pac-Man, what's up?" Pac-Man: "ME you bitches! I'm high on crack! Wanna freebase?" band: "No Pac-Man - Drugs are bad!" "Nope, can't help you man." Pac-Man: "PUSSIES!" (sounds of someone taking a hit) WHOA! HOLY SHIT! (music is the Pac-Man theme over a drumline) (song resumes)  I also feel the need to quote Pantera now. Actually, I think I need to go to church, stand up in front of the choir, and sing this over the p.a.  Pantera, "Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills" (mostly spoken, with a nasty "i fucked your girlfriend last night" kind of drawl to it)  I fucked your girlfriend last night. While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love. She called me daddy and I called her baby when I smacked her ass.  I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight.  And I slept with her all over me, from forehead to ribcage I dripped her ass. Sometimes I thought you might be spying, living out some brash fantasy, but no. You were knocked out.  But we were all knocked out you know. In a way I serve too many masters. We didn't know you'd break the bottle that the magic came in to use those jagged shards to slit our wrists and neck. And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude. But you wouldn't know what you were doing because I didn't, your girlfriend could have been a burn victim, an amputee, a dead body - But god damn I wanted to fuck. I'm serving too many fucking masters. I told you. I told you motherfucker
