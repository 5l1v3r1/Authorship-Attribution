I got a .torrent of every cd Rammstein has put out. I've been listening to german industrial metal all day, and it's been doing things to me. I'm different now. I want to grind things. I want to wear military gear and rubber pipes and sing in german. But I'll get over it. I also downloaded lots and lots of porn. Mostly pictures, so it's not like I have to go buy a 50pack of dvd-r media to hold it all - but it's still a lot of porn. I have an excuse for it now, tho. I got an idea for a weird picture involving lots of porn pictures. I'll post it when I make it.   current music:  Rammstein - all of it. Actually, my playlist has 82 Rammstein songs, and 1 Bloodhound Gang song - "You're Pretty When I'm Drunk." It's right after "Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen"   Word Of The Moment:   urlLink Prurient , as in "In the prurient interest", which is how you determine if something is offensive and should be banned, or if it's sexxxxxayy, and should be masturbated to. Prurience is an inordinate interest in sex. So it's every human male between 13-18.
