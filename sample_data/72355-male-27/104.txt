The Interna-....fuck it.   Yeah, so I called the truck guy about the international to see if I could work out a payment plan. somebody put a down payment on it today. so fuck. I don't really want to talk about it anymore. In any case, I know that if I ever start a band, i'm gonna call it The Failures. Although, as a quick search just turned up, there are already a couple bands named the Failures, as if I care.    Stuck In My Head:  Oh, man... I don't even know if I should put this one up. This is one of those songs that *WILL* get into your head, just by seeing the fucking title, and it will never leave, Ever. Ever.  urlLink "Iko Iko" by the Belle Stars.  Yeah, you know, from Rain Man...
