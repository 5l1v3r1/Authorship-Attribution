Oops.   I keep forgetting to list the music I'm listening to. I wasn't actually listening to any music when I posted just now, but I fired up 'purity' by slipknot just now, so I guess that counts. Although, I will tel you what song just started playing in my cruel cruel internal jukebox...   current music in my head:   urlLink michael mcdonald 'I keep forgetting'  There, now it'll be in your head, too. Hahahahaha. By the way, the music from this song was used in a more recent song: 'regulators' by nate dogg and warren g. they managed to make it sound like some kind of tough guy music, rather than the lame crapfest it is now.
