(cowboy twilight) HI BOYS AND GRRLS! (boys and girls in unison, except for llama boy, but nobody minds him) HI COWBOY TWILIGHT!!!! (cowboy twilight) DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS!?!?!?!?!?! (children in unison, except for llama boy) IT'S RANDOM LINK TIME!!!!!!!! (announcer, speaking very quickly) randomlinktimeiscopyrighted1952byeclipsestudiossomerestrictionsapplyallrightsrexervedexceptforllamaboyoffernotvalidinpanamacubaortexasbecausetexassucks (cowboy twilight) THAT'S RIGHT! SO HERE WE GO!!!   urlLink Best Toilets  Somebody actually maintains this list of all the best public restrooms in various cities. And I thought I was weird.  urlLink Tetrachromats  There is at least one woman in the world who can see more colors than everybody else because she has 4 sets of cones in her eyes instead of the usual three.  urlLink International Space Station Visibility Data  Now you can get up real early, look at a twinkle in the sky for 2 minutes, and go "Gee".  urlLink THE CLAW  Not quite a joystick, but not a keyboard either. Probably the most innovative game controller since the joystick. Or maybe the Power Glove.  urlLink Being Seen Technologies  Makers of electroluminescent strips, which are like neon, but better. And cheaper. And really flexible. I gotta get me some of that.  urlLink Interlink Electronics  They make these badass mice from stainless steel that you can beat on with a hammer. (I can do that to my mouse, bit I'd have to buy another one afterwards).  urlLink Pricewatch  Ok, Ok, so I'm a nerd. But I like this place. It's the quickest way to get the lowest price on computer hardware on the web.  urlLink Happy Pipes  I don't actually have a use for this, but they do have some really cool handblown glass bongs and stuff. I just wanna spread the love is all.
