Now THIS is irritating.   See, I work a lot, and I planned to use my two days off to go out and take me some pictures. I had it all planned out: I had gatorade and water so I didn't dehydrate in the hot sun, I had my batteries charged up, I got my cam back from sar, along with his mutated telescope tripod, I was *ready*. and I wake up today - and it's raining. Even if it quits raining, it'll be all muddy out there, and it's going to be overcast all day, which will make all my pics look sad and crappy. Whee. In other news:  urlLink Check this out.  They don't sell a weather machine, tho, so screw 'em.
